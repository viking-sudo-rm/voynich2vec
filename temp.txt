De statura et vita Karoli regis .
This kyng Charlis was of a fayr̛ statur , for he was viij fute long & wele shapyn̛ & awfuƚƚ to sight ; & he was passand̛ large of renys , & he was clenlie bothe in bely & in armys & had grete theis ; & he was a passand̛ wyse knyght & a bitter & strong of lym̛ .
& his face was in lenthe oderhalfe palme ( and̛ his berd̛ a fute long ) , & his nese emyddiste þerof & halfe þat lentℏ .
& his fored̛ was a fute long , and he had een̛ like a lyon̛ þat shane as a precious stane , and his browis was a palm̛ brede .
And if he had bene wrathe & lukid̛ on̛ a man̛ he wolde hafe flayed̛ hym̛ .
And his gyrdyƚƚ was viij fute lang with-oute þat at hang .
And he ete bod littyl brede , bod at ans he wolde ete a quarter of a weddur , or ij hennys , or a guse , or a swyne shulder , or a pacok , or a crane , or a hale hare .
And he wolde drynk bod esy wyne , bod if it war medlid̛ with watir .
& he was of suche strenthe þat , at a strake with his swerd̛ , he wald̛ cut in sonder ane armyd knyght syttand on̛ a hors fro þe crown̛ of þe hede vnto þe sole of þe fute , & his hors als ; and he wolde lightlie breke iiij hors shone at ans , and he wold̛ lifte eselie to his hede ane armyd knyght stondyng on̛ þe luff of his hand̛ .
And̛ he bare tables with hym̛ þat he bare aƚƚ his actis in .
And he drank bod seldom̛ mor̛ þan̛ thrise at his meat .
And he luffid̛ wele to ride and bere armys , and he made his doghters to be clothe-makers , & for to lere at spyn̛ on̛ þe rokk̘ , at þai sulde nott be ydiƚƚ .
And at Coleyn̛ he garte byg ij briggis Page 291 our̛ þe watir of Reine .
And when̛ he come to Rome he wold̛ light a myle with-oute þe town̛ , & go vnto þe cetie apon̛ his fute , & kys euer-ilk kurk dure , & giff grete rewardis vnto euer-ilk kurk̘ .
And he delyverd̛ þe Holie Lande oute of Saracens handis , and come fro thens-ward be Constantynople ; and he broght thens many wurthi relikkis , þat is to say , parte of þe crown̛ of our̛ Lord̛ , whilk þat florisshid̛ in his syght , and ane of þe naylis þat our Lord̛ was naylid̛ vnto þe cros with , and His sudarie , & our̛ Ladie sarke , and Saynt Symeon̛ arm̛ .
And aƚƚ þies he putt in a kurk of our Layde þat he byggid̛ , and he fowndid̛ & byggid̛ als many abbays as þer was lettres in þe Abce .
And in euer-ilk one of þaim he lefte a letter of golde .
And at þe laste , when̛ his son̛ Lowis was crownyd̛ , he was fuƚƚ of gude werkis & decesid̛ , and was berid̛ at Aquis Granum in a kurk of our̛ Ladye þat he byggid̛ .
And yit or he dyed̛ he callid̛ samen aƚƚ his prelattis , & gaff þaim aƚƚ his tresurs to distribute þaim whar̛ þaim þoght nede emang þer kurkis .
