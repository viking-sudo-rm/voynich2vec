1. PRIMA PARS.
Sirs ; quod I / sith of ȝour curtesye 
I entred am / in-to ȝour companye, 
And admitted / a talë for to telle 
By hym þat haþ pouer to compelle, 
I mene our hoste, gouernour and guyde 
Of ȝow echon / ridyng her be-side; 
Thogh that my wit / barayn be and dul, 
I wol reherce / a story wonderful, 
Towchinge the siege / and destruccioun 
Of worthy Thebees / the myghty Royal toun, 
Bylt and begonne / of olde antiquitè, 
Vpon the tyme / of worthy Iosuè, 
Be dyligence / of kyng Amphioun, 
Chief causë first / of his fundacioun, 
For which his fame / which neuere shal away, 
In honure floureth / ȝit vnto this day, 
And in story / remembred is and preised.
But how the wallys / weren on heghte reised, 
It is wonder / and merveil forto here. 
11
But if ȝe list / I shal ȝow platly lere 
The maner hool / shortly in sentence, 
Vnder support / of ȝoure pacience, 
As writ myn auctour / and bochas both two, 
Rede her bookes / and ȝe shal fynde it so, 
How this kyng / thys prudent Amphyoun, 
How kyng Amphyoun was þe first þat bilt the Cyte of Thebes be þe swetnesse of his soune.


With the swetnesse / and melodious soun 
And armonye / of his swetë song 
The Cytè bylt / that whilom was so strong, 
Be vertue only / of the werbles sharpe 
That he made / in Mercuries harpe, 
Of which the strengës / were not touchëd softe, 
Wherby the wallës / reisëd weren a-lofte, 
With-outë craft / of eny mannys hond, 
Ful ȝoor agon / myd of Grekës lond; 
which is a þing / of Poetës told, 
Neuere yseyn / neither of ȝong nor old.
But, as Bochas / list to specifie, 
Cler expownyng / this derkë poysye, 
The exposicioun of Iohn Bochas vpon þis derk poysie.


Seith Mercurye / god of Eloquence, 
ȝaf, be the myght / of heuenly influence, 
Vnto this kyng / at His natiuitè 
Thorgh glade aspectës /, that he shuldë be 
Most excellent / be craft of Rethorik, 
That in this world / was non to hym lik; 
Which signyfieth / to hem that ben prudent, 
12
The significacioun of þe harpe of Mercure.

The Musycal / the lusty instrument,
I mene the harpë / most melodious, 
yovë to this kynge / be Mercurius, 
And his song / this auctour can ȝow teche, 
was no thyng / but the crafty speche 
Of this kyng / ycallëd Amphioun; 
Wher-by He made / the contrès envyroun 
To han such lust / in his wordës swete, 
That were so plesaunt / fauourable, and mete
In her Eerys / that shortly ther was noon 
How kyng Amphion, be mediacion of his soft spech, wan þe loue & þe hertes of the puple.

Disobeysaunt / with the kyng to goon,
Wher so euere / that hym list assigne. 
His cheer / his port / was outward so benygne, 
That thorgh his styring / and exortacioun 
With hym they went / to byldë first this toun, 
And forsook / ecch man his contrè, 
Be on assent / to makë this Cytè 
Royal and riche / that lich was nowher noon. 
And thus the wallis / made of lym and stoon, 
Were Reysëd first / be syngyng of this kyng, 
lich as Poetys / feyne in her writyng, 
Passyng Rich / and Royal of entaille.
Her may ȝe See / how myche may avaylle 
The goodlihed / and lownesse of a kyng, 
13
And specealy / in cher and in spekyng, 
To his lyeges / and to bern hym fayre 
Nota.


In his apport / and shewe hym debonayre, 
What availeþ to a kyng or to a prince to ben goodly and benygne of his port to his puple.


And nat to bene / to straungë ne soleyn 
In contenaunce / outward / be disdeyn; 
Which causeþ ofte /, who that Can aduerte, 
Grete hatred / in the puples herte, 
And ther-vpon . / priuely wol rowne, 
Whan a pryncë / doth vp-on hem frowne, 
Shortly deme / for al his excellence, 
Among hem-silf / out of his presence, 
Euerych concludë / lich his fantasye. 
And thus ful ofte / gendred is Envye 
In folkës hertes / of soleyntè and pryde, 
For swich as list / nat onys loke a-syde 
To Reward hem / whan they lowë loute.
And ageyn kynde / it is . out of doute, 
That eny hed / be recorde of the wyse, 
Shuld the foot / of disdeyn despyse 
Which bereþ hym vp /, who so can takë hede, 
How þe poor puple supporten and beren vp þe estat of a kyng.


And Susteneth / in his mostë nede 
As his Pyler / and his sowpowayle. 
14
For fynaly /, ne werë the porayle 
her berer vp / and Supportacioun, 
Farwel lordshyp / and domynacioun 
Thorgh-oute the world / of euery hegh estat! 
Wherfor me semeþ / mor is Fortunat 
Of Mercurye / þe sootë sugred harpe 
Than Mars / swerd / whetted kene and sharpe, 
Nota.

Mor accepted / wiþ asspectis goode 
What the goodlihede of a prince avaylleth to wynne the hertes of his puple.

Than is this god / with his lokës woode. 
For humble speche / wiþ glad contenaunce 
May a pryncë / sothly mor avaunce 
Among his puple / Hertës forto wynne 
Of inward louë / which that wol not twynne, 
Than gold / rychessë / pride / or tyranye, 
Outher disdeyne / daunger / or surquedye. 
For of lordes /, as Clerkës can reporte, 
But that loue / her crownë do supporte, 
The fyn ys noght / in conclusioun. 
Ensample of kyng Amphioun.

I Takë record / of kyng Amphyoun, 
That byltë Thebës be his elloquence 
Mor than of Pride / or of violence, 
Noble and riche / that lik was nowher non, 
And thus the wallës / mad of lym and stoon 
Were reisëd first / be syngyng of this kyng, 
lich as Poetës / feyn in her wryting.
How aftere the opynyoun of some auctours

But sothly ȝit / Some expositours, 
Groundyng hem / vpon olde auctours, 
15
Seyn that Cadmvs / the famous olde man,

Ful longe afor / this Citè first began 
And the ground / of the bieldyng sette, 
And the boundës / be compas out-mette 
With thong out-korve / of a boolys hyde, 
Whych envyroun / strecchë myghtë wyde 
To get Inne londe / a ful largë space 
Wher-vp-on to byld / a dwellyng place, 
And callëd was the Soyle / þus geten Inne, 
How þe contre of Boece toke first his name of a bolys skyn, After called Thebes.


Whylom Boece / of the bolys skynne. 
The name after / into Thebës turned.
But Cadmus ther / hath longe not soiourned, 
lik in Story / as it is compyled; 
For shortly he from thennys was exiled, 
How kyng Cadmus was exiled out of Thebes be prowesse of kynge Amphyoun.


Neuer after to dwellen in this toun, 
Be the knyghthode of this Amphioun, 
Which vp parformeth / riche for the noonys 
The Citè Thebes / of myghty squarë stonys, 
As I ȝow tolde / a litil here to-forn; 
16
And Cadmus þus / hath his kyngdam lorn, 
Sceptre and crowne / and his powere Royal.
Now have I told / vnto ȝou / ground of al, 
That ȝe wel knowe / be Informacioun 
Cleerly the pith / and exposicioun 
Of this mater / as clerkës can ȝou telle.

To tary ȝow / as in this matiere,

And now ȝe knowë / first how Amphyoun 
Bylt and began / this Citè and this toun, 
Regnyng ther / long aftere, as I rede.
Of hym no morë /; for I wil procede 
To my purpoos / that I first began: 
How þe lyne of Amphioun be discent was conveied to kyng layus.

17
And Iocasta / callëd was his wyff, 
Ful wommanly / the story seith certeyn, 
For a tymë / thogh she were bareyn, 
Tyl Layus / in ful humble wise 
To haue a child / didë Sacrifise, 
Fyrst to apollo / in his char so briȝt, 
And Iubiter / that haþ so gret a myght,

That his request / may excecuted be; 
And specially / to Goddesses thre,

And his preyere / accepted was ful sone, 
That fynaly / thorgh his ryytys olde,

Be Fatal sort / which may not be wiþdrawe, 
That with his swerd / his fader shal be slawe; 
Ther may no man helpe it / nor excuse.
On whiche thyng / the kyng gan sorë muse, 
And cast he wolde / on that other side 
Agayn her doom / for hym-silf provide, 
Shape a way / and remedy to-forn, 
Biddyng the queenë / whan the chyld were born, 
With-oute Mercy / or moderly pytè 
That he be ded /: it may non other be. 
And in al hast / lik as he hath sent, 
She obeyëd / his comaundëment.

To certeyn men / ordeynëd for þe noonys 
From poynt to poynt / in al maner þing

20
They durste not delay it / nor abide, 
But to a Forest / that stood fer besyde, 
They took Her wey and faste gan hem spede 
The kyngges wille / to parforme in dede, 
Havyng therof / passyng hevynesse. 
But whan that they / beheelden the fairnesse 
Of the Chyld / and excellent beautè, 
In her hertë / they hadde grete pytè, 
And pleynly cast /, among hem was no stryf, 
That the child / shuldë han his lif. 
And anon ful hygh / vpon a tre, 
In a placë / that no man myght se, 
They henge hym vp / the story kan reherce. 
But first his feet / þorgh / they gan to perce, 
And on bowës tendre / tough, and smale, 
They knet hym vp / shortly þis is no tale, 
Hym to preserue / from bestys wild and Rage. 
And after that / they token her viage 
Toward Thebës / in alle the hast they may.
But of fortunë / thilke samë day 
with her houndës / serchyng vp and doun, 
The huntës went / of kyng poliboun 
Thorgh the forest / gamë forto fynde, 
Some aforn / and somë / cam behynde, 
21
And gan serch / and sekë wonder sore 
Among the hillës / and the holtës hore. 
And as they Reenge / the trenchis by and by, 
They herde a noyse / and a pitous cry 
How the huntys of kyng Poliboun fonde the chyld in þe forest / and presented hym to þe kynge.


Of thys chyld / hangyng on the tre; 
And all at onys / drowë forto se, 
And lefte not til they han hym founde; 
And toke hym doune / and his fete vnbounde, 
And bare hym hom / vnto Polyboun, 
Kyng of Archadye / the famous Regioun. 
And whan that he / first þe chyld gan See, 
Of his woundës / he hadde grete pytè, 
To beholde / his tender fete / so blede; 
And callëd hym / Edippus / as I rede, 
which is to seyn /, platly this no phage, 
Borëd the feete / as in that langage.
And first the kyng in his Royal halle 
Made his men / an norys for-to calle, 
This ȝonge chylde to foster and to kepe 
With her Milk / that he nat ne wepe; 
And his leches / he chargëd ek also, 
Til he were Hool / Her deuer forto do: 
Fully in purpoos / for the child was fair, 
After his day / to maken hym his hayr; 
For cause only /, who so taketh hede, 
Sone hadde he noon / be lynë to succede; 
22
And Whether that he had / a wif or noon, 
I fyndë not / and therfor lat it goon.
But by processe / of dayës and of ȝeeris, 
This Edyppus / among his pleying feeris 
was in his port / passyng ful of pride, 
That non with hym / myght in pees abide. 
In hert he was / so Inly Surquydows, 
Malencolik / and Contrarious, 
Ful of despyt / and of hegh disdeyn, 
That no wight durstë / shortly hym with-seyn; 
Til on a day / he gan with oon debate 
To whoom he haddë / specyaly grete hate, 
Which of Rancour / and of hasty tene, 
As he that myght / His pridë not sustene, 
Gan vpon hym / cruelly abrayde, 
And vnto hym felly / thus he saide: 
“wherto,” quod he / “artow so proude of port, 
Contrarie also / euer / in oure disport, 
Froward and felle / lastyng euere in oon, 
As thow were lord / of vs euerichon, 
And presumest fully in wyrchyng, 
Lik as thow were sone / vnto the kyng, 
And descended / of His Royal blood? 
23
But wher so be / thow be wroth or wood, 
Thow art no thing /, and thow list takë hede, 
Appartenyng / vnto his kynrede, 
But in a Forest / founden and vnknowe, 
whan thow were ȝonge /. therfor bere the lowe! 
And vttrely remembre, ȝif the lyst, 
Thy byrth and blood / ar bothe two vnwist. 
This the fyne / shortly / of my tale.
Wherwith Edippus / gan to wexë pale, 
And chaunge also cheer and contenaunce, 
And gan a-point / in his remembraunce 
Word be word / and forgat right nouȝt, 
And felly / musëd / in his ownë thouȝt, 
And cast he wold / with-oute more tarying 
The trouth enquere / of poliboun the kyng. 
And whan he saugh / opportunë space, 
And the kyng / in a sycrè place, 
He hym bysoghte / lowly on his kne 
To his request // benignëly to se, 
And that he woldë / pleynly / and not spare 
Of his byrth / the trewë ground declare, 
And make hym sure / of this thyng anon 
ȝif he were / his verrey sone or non.
24
And Polyboun / only of gentilles, 
whan he beheeld / the gretë hevynesse 
Of Edippus / and the wooful peyne, 
he gan dissimule / and in manere feyne, 
lik as he had be / verrely his heyre. 
But mor and more / he falleth in dispeir, 
And doune on kneës / eft a-geyn gan falle, 
Hym coniuring / be the goddës alle 
To tellë trouth / and no thyng to hide; 
Affermyng ek / he woldë nat abide 
Lenger with hym / but ryden and enquere, 
Til tyme he may / the verrey sothe lere 
In eny part of hap or of fortune.
And for that he / was so inportune 
In his desire, the kyng with-out abood 
Ceriously / tolde hym how it stood, 
In a Forest first / how he was founde 
Vpon a tre / be the feet ybounde, 
And how he caste, in conclusioun, 
To make hym kyng / of that regioun 
Aftere his day / shortly forto telle.
But Edippus / wil no lenger dwelle, 
But took lieve / and in hast gan ryde 
To a temple / faste ther be-syde 
25
Of Appollo / in storie as is tolde, 
Whos statue / stood / in a char of golde 
On whelës four / boornyd bright and shene; 
And with-In a spirit / ful vnclene, 
Be fraude only / and fals collusioun, 
Answere gaf / to euery questioun, 
Bryngyng the puple in ful gret errour, 
Such as to hym dyden fals honour 
Be Rytys vsëd in the oldë dawes 
Aftere custome / of paganysmes lawes. 
And Edyppus / with ful humble chere, 
To Appollo makëd His preiere, 
Besechyng hym on his kneës lowe, 
Be some signë / that he myghte knowe, 
Thorg Evidencë Shortly comprehendyd, 
Of what kynredë / that he was discendyd.
And whan Edyppus be gret deuocioun, 
Fynysshëd hath / fully his orysoun, 
The fend anon / with-Innen Invisyble, 
With a vois dredful and horrible, 
Bad hym in hast / taken his viage 
Toward Thebës / wher of his lynage 
He herën shal / and be certefied.
And on his way / anon he haþ hym hyed, 
by hasty Iournè / so his hors constreyned 
26
Day be day / til he haþ atteyned 
Vnto a castel / Pylotës ycalled, 
Rich and strong / and wel aboute walled, 
Adiacent / be syyt of the contrè 
And perteynent to Thebes the Cytè:
kyng Layvs / beyng ther present, 
For-to holde a maner tornement 
With his knyghtës / ȝong and coraious, 
And other folkës / that were desyrous 
To preue hem-silf /, shortly for-to telle, 
Who by force / other myght excelle, 
Or gete a namë / thorgh his hegh prouesse. 
Euerich of hem / dyd his bysynesse 
On hors-bak / and also ek on foote, 
Al be that somë founde ful vnsoote, 
Rather a pley of werrë / than of pees; 
Wher Edyppus put hym-silf in prees, 
As he that was / ay redy to debat, 
Enforsyng hym / to entren at the gate, 
How Edippus slogh his fader of ignoraunce at þe castel.

Maugrè all tho / that hym woldë lette.
And in the pres / of aventure he mette 
Kyng layvs / and cruelly hym slogh, 
Thow the story / writ not the maner howh, 
Ne no wight can / of alle the companye 
27
Be no signë / verrely espye 
By whos hond / that the kyng was slawe; 
For Edyppus in hast / gan hym with-drawe 
And kept hym Coy / of entencioun. 
Gret was the noyse / and the pitous soun 
In the Castel / for slaughter of the kyng, 
Dooel and compleynt / sorowe and wepyng.
But for they segh / hevynesse and thoght 
Ageynës deth . vayleth lit or noght, 
They ordeyne with Ryytys ful Royal 
For the feste / callëd / Funeral. 
And lik the custom / of the dayës olde, 
The corps they brent / into asshes colde, 
And in a vessel / rounde, mad as a bal, 
They closëd hem in gold and in metal. 
And after that did her bysy Cure 
In Thebës to make a sepulture, 
And richëly, hem list no lenger lette, 
The asshen didë they enclose and shette.
Of this matere / ther ys no mor to seyn. 
But to Edippus / I wil retourne ageyn, 
Which hym enhasteþ / ay fro day to day 
Towardës Thebes / in al that euere he may, 
Brennyng in herte / hoot as eny fire, 
The fyn to knowe / of his fatal desire.
But, for that he failëd / of a Guyde, 
Out of his way / he wente fer be-side, 
28
How Edippus passed by the hyll wher the monstre lay that was called Spynx.

Thorgh a wylde / and a waast contrè, 
By a mounteyn / that stood vpon the see, 
Wher that monstres / of many dyuers kynde 
Were conuersaunt / in story as I fynde; 
Amongës which / sothly ther was on, 
So Inly cruel / that no man durst gon, 
For drede of deth / forby that passage. 
The descripcioun of the foule Monstre.

This monstre was so mortal in his rage, 
which hadde also /, be descripcioun, 
Body and feet / of a fers lyoun; 
And lik a mayde in soth was hede and face, 
Fel of his look / and cruel to manace, 
And odyous of countenaunce and sight;
And as I redë /, Spynx / this monstre hight, 
Wors than Tygre / dragon / or serpent. 
And I supposë / by enchauntement 
He was ordeynëd / on the hyl tabyde, 
To sleen all tho / that passëden be-syde, 
And specially / all that diden fayle 
To expowne / his mysty dyvynaile, 
His problem ek / in wordës pleyn and bare 
With-oute avys / opynly to declare, 
Or with the lif / he myghte not eskape. 
This verray soth platly and no Iape.
And ȝif that he, be declaracioun, 
Ȝaf ther-vpon / cleer exposicioun, 
He shuld in hast / there was non oþer mene, 
29
Sleen this monstre / for al his cruel tene. 
Ther may of mercy / be / non oþer graunte.
But of al this Edyppus ignoraunte, 
This dredful hill / stondyng on a roche, 
Er he was war / gan ful nygh approche, 
More perilous platly / than he wende. 
And sodeynly / the monster gan descende, 
To stoppen his way / and letten his passage, 
Thus abraydyng . with a fel corage:
“I haue in herte Inly gret disport 
That fortune / haþ broght the to my sort, 
To make a preef / ȝif thow mayst endure, 
The fatal ende / of this auenture, 
Set at a fyn / sothly be daiës olde.” 
And by and by / al the caas hym tolde, 
Charging hym to be wel war and wise, 
Gete the palme / and bere away the pryse 
Touchyng this thyng / sette a-twene vs tweyn, 
with lyf or deth / which we shal dareyn.
And this Monstre / with a despitous chere 
his problem gan / thus as ȝe shal here.
“Ther is a beest merveilous to se, 
The which in soth at his natiuyte 
Is of his myght / so tender and so grene, 
Of the problem that Spynx putte to Edippus.


That he may hym-siluë nat sustene 
Vpon his fete / thogh he hadde it sworn, 
But ȝif that he / be / of his moder born. 
30
And afterwardës / be processe of age, 
On fourë fete / he makeþ his passage; 
After on thre / if I shal not feyne, 
And alderlast / he goþ vpright on tweyne; 
Dyuers of port / and wonderful of cherys: 
Til, be length / of many sondry ȝeeres, 
Naturely / he goth aȝeyn on thre, 
And sith on foure, it may non oþer be, 
And Fynaly / this the trouthë pleyn, 
he retourneth / kyndëly ageyn 
To the matere / which that he kam fro.
loo / her is al / . my problem is I-do. 
Muse her-vpon / with-outë werre or stryff 
It to declare / or ellis lese thy lyff.”
And whan Edyppus / gan this þing aduerte, 
Wel assurëd in his manly herte, 
Gan in his wytt cerchen vp and doun, 
And of prudencë / cast in his resoun, 
Be grete avis / what thyng this may be; 
Seyng also / that he may not flee, 
and how ther was / counsel noon ne rede, 
But tellë trouth / or ellys to be dede.
And be ful good / deliberacioun 
Thus he answerd / in conclusioun, 
‘Thowe Spynx’ quod he / ‘fals and fraudulent! 
Thow foulë Monstre / thow dragon, thow serpent! 
which on this hyl / lich as I conceyve, 
lyst in a-waite / folkës to deceyue, 
31
But truste wel / for al thy sleghty wit, 
Thy falsë fraude / shal anon be qwyt. 
Me list not nowe whisper neither rowne, 
But thy problem / I shal anon expowne 
So opynly / thow shalt not go ther-fro. 
How Edippus expounded the problem that Spynx put to hym.


loo! this it is /. tak good hede therto!
Thilkë best thow spak of herto-forn, 
Is euery man / in this world yborn, 
Which may not gon / his lymës be so softe, 
Bot as his moder / bereth hym alofte 
In her armes / whan he doth crye or wepe. 
And after that / he gynneth forto crepe 
On fourë feet in his tendre ȝouth, 
Bexperience / as it is oftë kouth, 
A-forn yrekned / his hondës bothë two. 
And by processe / thow mayst consider also 
With his two fete / for al thy fellë tene, 
He hath a staf / hym-seluen to sustene, 
And than he goth / shortly vpon thre. 
And alther-last / as it most nedës be, 
Voyding his staf / he walkeþ vpon tweyn: 
Til it so be / thorgh agë / he atteyn, 
That lust of ȝouthe wasted be and spent; 
Than in his hond / he taketh a potent, 
And on thre feet / thus he goth ageyn, 
32
I dar afferme / thow maist it not withseyn, 
And sone aftere / thorgh his vnweldy myght, 
By influence / of naturys right, 
Bexperience / as euery man may knowe, 
Lich a child / on foure he crepeth lowe. 
And for he may no whylë here soiourne, 
To erth ageyn / he most in hast retourne, 
Which he kam fro /, he may it not remewe. 
For in this world / no man may eschewe, 
This verray soth / shortly and no doute, 
Whan the wheel of kyndë cometh aboute, 
And naturely hath his cours y-Ronne 
Be circuete / as doth the shenë sonne, 
That man and chyld / of hegh and lowe estat, 
It geyneth nat / to makë / mor debat, 
His tymë sette / that he mostë fyne, 
Whan Autropos / of malice doth vntwyne 
His lyvës thred / by Cloto first compowned. 
Loo / her thy problem / fully is expowned, 
At oure metynge / as I took on honde, 
To the lawe / that thow most nedës stonde 
And in al hast / of myn hondës deye, 
But of reson / thow can it ought withseye.’
And so this Spynx / awapyd and amaat, 
33
Stood / disamayëd / and dysconsolaat, 
With Chier doune-cast / Muët, pale, and ded. 
And Edippus anon smote of the hed 
Of this fende / stynkyng and vnswete, 
And the Contrè sette holy in quyete; 
Wherby he hath / such a pris ywonne 
That his fame is euery cost yronne 
Thorgh al the londe / that he the monstre hath slawe.
And lynë-right / to Thebës he gan drawe, 
Wel receyuëd / for his worthynesse, 
For his manhode / and his grete prouesse. 
And for they segh / he was a semly knyght, 
Wel fauourëd / in euery mannys sight, 
And sawh also Thebës the myghty toun, 
Not only they / but al the Regioun, 
Weren destitut / of a gouernour, 
Aȝeynst her foon / hauyng no socour 
Hem to defendë / but the quene allon; 
Among hem-self / makyng ful gret mon, 
For heire was non / as bookës specifie, 
The Sceptre / or crownë forto occupie: 
For which the lordës all be on assent 
with-Inne the toun / set a parlement, 
Shortly concludyng / if it myghte ben, 
34
Prudently to trete with the quene, 
Namëly they / that helde hem-silf most sage, 
To condescende / be way of Mariage, 
She to be Ioynëd to this manly knyght, 
Passing prudent / and famous ek of myght, 
Most likly man /, as they can discerne, 
The worthy Cytè / to kepen and gouerne.
And thorgh counsayl / of the lordës alle 
To her desyre / pleynly / she is falle, 
And accorded / with-oute mor tarying, 
That of Thebës / Edippus shal be kyng, 
By ful assent /, was non that seidë nay. 
And tymë set / ageyn a certeyn day 
Among hem-silf / and finaly devysed, 
The weddyng was / in Thebës solempnyzed 
Ful ryally, which nedës most vnthryve, 
Only for he his moder / toke to wyve, 
Vnwist of bothë / he was of her blode, 
And ignoraunt /, shortly, how it stode, 
That he to-forn hadde his fadere slawe, 
For which this weddyng was ageyn the lawe.
And to-for god / is neiþer feire ne good, 
Nor acceptable / blood to touche blood: 
Which cause hath ben of gret confusioun 
In many londe / and many Regyoun, 
Grounde and roote / of vnhap and meschaunce, 
The fyn concludyng / alway with vengeaunce, 
As men han seie / by cleer experience; 
35
And holy writ / recordeth in sentence 
How herodës / falsly in his lyff 
By violencë toke his brother wyf, 
For she was faire / and plesaunt to his sight, 
And kepte her stille / be forcë / þorgh his myght, 
Al be to her / he haddë / title non; 
And for her sake / the holy man seynt Iohn 
For his trouth / in prison lost his hede.
Therfor I rede / euery man take hede, 
Wherso he be Pryncë, lorde, or kyng, 
That he be war teschewë such weddyng, 
Er that the swerde / of vengeaunce hym manace, 
lest he lesë / hap, fortune, and grace; 
Takyng ensample / in al manere thynge 
Of Edyppus / in Thebës crownëd kyng; 
Al be that he wroght of ignoraunce, 
Ful derk and blynde / of his woful chaunce. 
And ȝif vnwist / he of Innocence, 
As ȝe han herde, fil in such offence, 
For which he was punishëd and brought lowe, 
What ar they worthy that her errour knowe, 
And fro the knottë / list not to abstene 
Of such spousale / to god and man vnclene? 
I can not seyn / nor mor therof devise. 
Demeth ȝour-silf that prudent ben and wise, 
And Edippus / hath among in mynde, 
36
Of whom the weddyng, lik as ȝe may fynde, 
Vnhappy was / and passing odious, 
Infortunëd / and vngracious.
I am wery mor therof to write. 
The hatful processe / also to endyte 
I passe ouer, fully of entent; 
For ymenëus / was not ther present, 
Nor lucyna / list not ther to shyne, 
Ne ther was none / of the musys nyne 
By on accord / to makë melodye; 
For ther song not be heuenly Armonye 
Neither Clyo / nor Calyopë, 
On of the sustren / in nombre thriës thre, 
As they dydë whan philolegye 
Ascendid vp hegh aboue the skye 
To be weddid / this lady vertuous 
Vnto hir lord / þe god mercurius; 
As Marcian ynamëd / de Capelle, 
In his book of weddyng can ȝou telle, 
Ther concludyng in this mariage 
The poete, that whilom was so sage, 
That this lady, callëd sapience, 
I-wedded was vnto eloquence; 
As it sat wel, by heuenly purueaunce, 
hem to be ioyned / be knot of Aliaunce.
But bothë two, sothly, of entent 
37
At the weddyng / in Thebës were absent; 
That causëd after / grete aduersitè. 
For fynal eende / of that solempnytè 
was sorowe / and woo / and destruccioun, 
Vtter ruyne / of this Royal toun. 
Ther may no man helpe it nor socoure, 
For a tyme / in Ioyë / thogh they floure.
But at this weddyng /, platly forto telle, 
The Infortunat folk þat weren at þe weddynge.

Assuryd othës / at the fyn vntrewe: 
All thise folk / werën / at this weddyng newe, 
To make the towne / desolat and bare, 
As the story / after shal declare.
But ay in Thebës / with his wallës stronge 
Edyppus regneth / many day and longe. 
And as myn autour writ / in wordys pleyn, 
By Iocasta he had sonës tweyn, 
Ethyocles and also Polymyte 
And, in bokes / as sondry clerkës write, 
Doghtres two / ful goodly on to se, 
Of which the ton hight Antygonë, 
And that other / callëd was ymeyne, 
Of her beautè / Inly souereyn.
Edyppus ay devoyde / of werre and strif, 
with Iocasta ladde a mery lyf

Hadde envie / of his prosperitè. 
For whan he shon / most riche in his renoun, 
From her wheel / she plongëd hym a-doun 
Out of his Ioye / into sodeyn wo, 
As she is wonte / frowardly to do, 
And namely hem / that setten her affiaunce 
Of erthly trust / in her variaunce.
For whan this kyng / passing of gret myght, 
Sat with the quene / vpon a certeyn nyght, 
Casuelly whan his folk echon 
Out of his Chambre sodeynly wer gon, 
39
Or he was war / Iocasta gan byholde 
The Carectys of his woundës olde, 
Vpon his fete / enprented wonder depe; 
Turnyng her facë / brast out forto wepe 
So secrely / he myght it not espie. 
And she anon / fille intö a fantasie, 
Ay on thys thyng / musyng mor and more, 
And in her bed / gan to sighe sore.
And whan the kyng / conceyueth her distresse, 
He gan enquere / of her hevynesse 
Fully the cause / and occasioun; 
For he wil wite / in conclusioun, 
What her eileþ / and why she ferde so.
“My lorde,” quod she / “withoute wordës mo,

Is for that I in my tender age

For which the king / his fatë to eschewe,

To sle the childe / and haue therof no routh: 
And I anon bad with-outë slouth

Tragedia Senece de Edippo Rege thebarum.

But ȝe may reden in a Tragedye 
Of Moral Senyk fully his endynge, 
His dool, his meschief / and his compleynyng, 
How with sorow / and vnweldy age 
This Edippus / fille into dotage, 
lost his wit / and his worldly delit, 
And how his sonës / had hym in despit, 
And of disdeyn / tok of hym no kepe. 
And bookës seyn / his eyën out he wepe.
43
And as myn auctour liketh to devise, 
As his sones rebuke hym and dispise, 
Vpon a day / in a certeyn place 
Out of his hede / his eyën he gan race, 
And Cast at hem /, he can non other bote, 
And of malice / they trad hem vnder fote, 
Fully devoidë / both of loue and drede.
And whan Edippus / for meschief was thus dede,

Of crueltè / his sonës / han hym throwe, 
Wers than serpent / or eny tigre wood. 
Of Cursid stok / cometh vnkynde blood,

Al be the Roosë / grow / out of a thorn.

Passëd the throp / of Bowtoun on þe ble,

Advertyng nought / neither to right ne wronge, 
But eche of hem / to make her partie stronge, 
And his querele / proudely to sustene: 
From whoos hertës / was devoyded clene 
Of brotherhode / the faithful alliaunce. 
Fals Couetise / so made hem at distaunce,

For which he oght of resoun go to-forn

Whil his brother / sat in his Royal See

And rode hym forth / armëd briȝt in stele,

That he allon / myght haue possessioun 
50
Duryng his lif / fully of the toun. 
For which in hast /, havyng no felawe, 
Polymytë a-sidë gan hym drawe 
By a forest / Ioynyng to the See, 
knowyng right nought the syyt of the contrè, 
Ful of hillës / and of hegh mounteyns, 
Craggy Rochës / and but fewë playns, 
wonder dredful and lothsom of passage, 
And ther-with-al / ful of beestis rage; 
holdyng his way of hertë no thyng light, 
Maat and wery / til it drowe to nyght.
And al the day / beholdyng enviroun, 
He neyther saugh castel, toure, ne toun; 
The whiche þing / greuëd hym ful sore. 
And sodeynly / the se began to Rore, 
wynde and tempest / hidously tarise. 
The Reyn doune bete / in ful grisly wise, 
That man and beest / therof were adrad, 
And negh for ferë / gan to wexë mad,

But Polymyte / in this tempest huge, 
Allas the whilë / fyndeth no refuge,

Nor hym to schrowde / saugh nowher no socour 
Til it was passëd / almost mydnyght hour 
A largë spacë / that the sterrës clere, 
The clowdës voyde /, in heuene did appere; 
So that this knyght / out of the forest large 
How Polymytes cam into the lond of Arge.


Gan approchen / to the londe of arge, 
Seyng a palays myghty of beeldyng,
Of which Adrastus / callëd was the kyng, 
A manly man / riche and wonder sage, 
And ronnë was / somdel / into age, 
Born of the Ile / which callëd is Chysoun, 
And whylom sone / of the kyng Chaloun; 
And for his witt /, in story as is kouth, 
he chosen was / in his tendre ȝouth, 
Of alle Argë / to be crownëd kyng, 
Chief of alle Grece / by record of wryting, 
Not be dissent / nor successioun, 
But al only / of fre eleccioun 
To holde of Arge / the sceptre in his hond, 
As most worthy / of alle grekës lond, 
louëd and drad / for wisdam and Iustice.
And as the story / pleynly can devise, 
This worthy kyng haddë doghtres two, 
52
Passyng fair / and right good also. 
It were to longe / her beautè to discryve. 
And the eldest / callëd was Argyve, 
Deyphyle

Dëyfylë ynamëd the seconde. 
Adrastus

And Adrastus, lich as it is founde, 
This worthy kyng / haddë sonë non, 
To succede / after he be gon; 
For which he was duryng al his lyff 
Trist in hert / and passingly pensif. 
But hool his trust / and his hopë stod, 
Be Aliaunce / of some worthy blood 
Brouȝt Inne by mene / of his doghtres tweyn, 
That he shal be relesëd / of his peyne, 
Thorgh recomfort / of some hie mariage. 
The drem of kyng Adrastus of A bor and A lyoun.

And sothly yet ful high in his corage 
He troubled was be occasion 
Of a sweuen and a vision, 
Shewëd to hym / vpon a certeyn nyght. 
For as hym thoght / in his inward sight 
whyl he slept /, by cleer inspeccioun, 
A wyldë boor / and a fers lyoun 
Possedë shal, thise bestës in her Rage, 
His doghtres two / be bond of mariage 
In shorte tyme / with-In a certeyn day; 
which broght his herte / in ful grete affray. 
But þing in soth / that destinè hath shape, 
53
Her in this world / ful hard is to eskape; 
Eke merveylous / a man teschewe his faate.
And Polymyte / of whom I spak late, 
With the tempest / bete / and al be-reyned 
Be grace only / the Citè hath atteyned,
Wher Adrastus / ful statly of degrè, 
Thilkë tymë / helde his Royal see. 
The troubly nyght / myrk, and ful obscure, 
hath brought this knyght / only be auenture 
Thorgh the Citè, enclosëd with a wal, 
Vnto the paleys / chief and principal, 
Wher as the kynge / in his chambre alofte 
lay in his bed / and slepte wonder softe. 
Eke alle his folk / hadde her chambres take, 
lik as Fortune / peraunter haddë shape, 
The silfë tyme / be-cause it was so late; 
And Casuelly / no porter / at the gate, 
As it haddë be right for the nonys. 
And in a porchë / bilt of squarë stonys, 
Ful myghtëly enarchëd envyroun, 
wher the domys / and plees of the toun 
weren execut / and lawës of the kyng, 
And ther this knyght / without mor tarying, 
Wery and maat / from his stede alight, 
54
Hangynge the rene / in al the hast he myght, 
vppon his arme / surer hym to kepe, 
And leyde hym doune / and gan anon to slepe, 
As hym semptë / that tyme for the beste.
And whil that he lay thus forto reste, 
Of aventure / ther cam / a knyght ryding, 
The worthiest in this world lyvyng, 
Curteys, lowly / and right vertuous, 
As seith myn autour / Callëd Tidyus, 
Eurous in Armes / and manly in werkyng, 
Of his byrthe / sone vnto the kyng 
Of Calydonye / a londe of gret renoun. 
And he, allas / out of that Regioun 
Exilëd was / for he his brother sclowe, 
As Stace of Thebës / writ the manere howe, 
Al be that he / to hym no malys mente. 
For on a day / as they on huntyng wente 
In a forest / for herte / and for hynde, 
So as he stod vnder a grenë lynde, 
And Casuelly / lete his Arow Slippe, 
he slough his broder / callëd Menalippe, 
Thorgh mortal sort / his honde was begyled: 
For which / he was / banishëd and exiled, 
As the lawë / narowe / sette his charge.
55
And for this caas / he cam first to Arge,
Into the porche / wher polymytë slepe, 
Of auenture / ere he toke eny kepe, 
The samë nyght hidously beseyn 
With the tempest / of thonder / wynde / and reyn; 
And filt also / anoy / and gret damage, 
Thorgh the Forest holding his passage, 
As Polymytë haddë do to-forn, 
In peryl oftë / likly to be lorn, 
With beestës ragë / set on euery side, 
Til of grace with-outen eny guyde 
He rode thorgh Arge / the grete myghty toun, 
Streght to the paleys / and the chief dongoun, 
Lich as I tolde / wher polymytë lay; 
And at his comyng / made a gret affray, 
For he was blynde / þorgh derknesse of the nyght, 
And hym to gwyë / he ne fonde no liȝt 
whan he cam Inne / of priket nor of torche, 
Til he vnwarly / entred the porche, 
And wold han takë ther / his herbygage.
But Polymytë / stert vp in a rage, 
Sodeynly awakëd / as I rede, 
with the nyinge / of his proudë stede. 
And first of al / whan that he byhelde 
A knyght y-armed / vpon his brest a shelde, 
56
And gan the maner / of his aray aduerte, 
Of verrey Ire / vpon his hors he sterte, 
And cruelly gan tydingës enquere 
Whennys he cam / or what he dedë there, 
And bad in hast / his answer to devise. 
And Tydeus, in ful humble wise, 
Answerd ageyn / of verrey gentillesse, 
And seid in soth / that of hegh distresse, 
Of the tempest / and the derke nyght, 
he dryven was / lich an erraunt knyght, 
Of nede only / and of necessitè 
And high constreynt / of his adversitè, 
To takë loggyng / wher so that he myght; 
And in that courte / therfor he alight 
With-outë morë, thenkyng non outrage 
Nor to no wight / noyeng ne damage.
Than Polymyte / of malys / and hegh pride 
Tolde hym shortly / he shuldë not abide, 
Nor loggë ther / thogh he had it sworn. 
“For I,” quod he / “toke it vp to-forn 
And wil it kepë during al this nyght, 
I seie the platly / maugrè al thy myght.”
Quod Tydeus / ‘that is no curtesie 
57
Me to deuoyde / but rather vileynye, 
ȝif ȝe take hede / that seme a gentil knyght. 
And I suppose / ȝe han / no title of right 
To this loggyng / be way of heritage, 
More than haue I, for alle ȝoure fellë rage. 
And pardè / ȝit it shal be no desese, 
Til to morowe thogh ȝe do me ese, 
Of gentillesse / only with ȝoure leve; 
To suffre me / it shal litil greue.’
But ay the morë Tydeus spak faire, 
Polymytë was froward / and contrayre, 
And shortly seide / it geyneth not to stryve; 
That of force he shal devoidë blyve, 
Or vttrely / a-twen hem bothe two 
This thyng to Trië / he most haue ado.
And Tydeus, seyng / no bettre mene, 
Ful lik a knyght / in steel y-armëd clene, 
With-out abood / faste gan hym spede 
Wonder lyvely / forto take his stede, 
And thus thies knyghtës / pompous and ellat, 
For litil causë / fillen at debat. 
And as they ranne to-gider on horsbak, 
Euerich on other / first his sperë brak. 
How Tydeus and Polymyte strif for her loggyng.


And after that / ful surquedous of pride, 
With sharpë swerdës / they to-gyder ryde 
Ful yrously / thise myghty champiouns, 
In her fury / lik Tygres or lyouns.
58
And as they hurtle / that all þe paleis shoke, 
kyng Adrastus / out of his slep awoke, 
And made in hast his chamberleynës calle, 
And þorgh the courte / his worthy knyghtes alle, 
Comaundyng hem to descende and se, 
And reporte / what it myghte be, 
This wonder noyse / in his courte be nyght. 
And whan they saugh two straungë knyghtës fight 
In platys bright / and in thikkë maile, 
with-outë Iugë /, they hadde grete mervaile; 
And disamayëd / of this vnkouth þing, 
As they fond / toldë to the kyng.
And Adrastus / for derknesse of the nyght, 
From his Chambre / with many torchë light 
Into the courte / is discended doun, 
All his meynè / stondyng en-vyroun, 
Of thyes knyghtës having ful gret wonder. 
And of manhode / he put hem first a-sonder, 
Hem comaundyng / lich a gentil kyng, 
To leuen her strif and sesen of her fighting; 
And entred Inne with a knyghtly loke, 
And first fro hem / her swerdës both he took, 
59
Affermyng ek, as to his fantasie, 
It was a Rage / and a gret folye 
So wilfully / her lyvës / to Iuparte, 
with-outë Iuge / her querel to departe, 
And specialy / in the derkë nyght 
Whan neither myght of other han no sight, 
Charging hem vpon peyne of her lif 
To disseuer and styntyn of her strif.
And Tydeus in al the hast he myght, 
Ful humblely from his stede alight, 
And right mekely / with cheer and contenance 
Put hym hooly in the gouernance 
Of Adrastus / in al maner þing. 
And Polymyte / mad ek no tarying 
To light also / and woldë not wiþsey 
The kyngges biddyng / lowly to obey, 
So as hym ought / with duë reuerence. 
And as thei stoodë / both in his presence, 
He gan enquerë first / of her estaat, 
The cause also why they weren at debat, 
Of her cuntrees / sothly and her age, 
I-axed ek / touching her lynage, 
Be discent of what stok þei were born.
And Tydeus his answer / gaf to-forn; 
Toldë pleynly / and madë no lesyng, 
60
How that he was / sonë to the kyng 
Of Caledoyn / and riȝtful heir therto; 
And of his exile / the soth he told also, 
As ȝe han herde / in the storye rad.
And Polymyte / with cheer and facë sad, 
vnto þe kyng / touching his contrè, 
Seyde he was born / in thebës þe Citè, 
And Iocasta, the gretë famous quene, 
his moder was / with-outen eny wene. 
But of his fader / whilom kyng and lord, 
For verray shamë he spak not a word, 
Only for he / ȝif I shal not feyne, 
his fader was / and brother bothë tweyne: 
The which, in soth / he was ful loth to telle. 
And eke the kyng / wold hym not compelle 
Of gentillesse / but bad, with-oute blame, 
Of his birthë / forto haue no shame; 
For hool the caas / and maner euery dell, 
Touchyng his kynne / he knewe þe ground ful wel, 
lich as it was, by ful clier report; 
Enforsyng hym forto do comfort, 
with all his myght / and his bysy peyne, 
This manly kyng / to the knyghtes tweyne, 
And to hem seide / aforn hym as they stood, 
He wiste wel / þat of ful worthy blood 
They were dyscended / touchyng ther kynrede. 
And made in hast / his officerës lede 
61
The straungë knyghtës / beyng at debat, 
Thorgh his paleys / to chambres of estat, 
Eche by hym-silf / forto take his ese. 
And euery þing, in soth, that myght hem plese, 
was offred hem / lich to her estates.
And whan they weren / disarmëd of her platis, 
Cusshewës / Greuës / and her sabatons, 
her harneys voyded / and her habergons, 
Tweynë mantels / vnto hem wer broght, 
Frett with peerle / and richë stonys, wroght 
Of cloth of golde / and veluyt cremysyn, 
Ful richëly furrëd with hermyn, 
To wrap hem Inne / ageyn the colde morowe, 
After the rage / of her nyghtës sorowe, 
To take her reste / til þe sonne arise.
And than þe kyng / in ful prudent wise, 
First of alle / was not rekkëles 
Þe knyghtës hertës / for to sett in pees, 
that euer after, I dar afferme it wel, 
Eche was to other trew as eny stele 
During her lif / both in word and dede, 
vnder a knottë / bounde of broþerhede.
And Adrastus / þe worthy kyng famous, 
A feeste madë / riche and plenteuous, 
62
To thise knyghtës /, hym-silf ther-at present. 
And after mete / ful goodly he haþ sent, 
This noble kyng / for his doghters dere, 
Of gentyllessë / forto makë chere 
To the knyghtës / comë fro so ferre. 
And lik in soth / as lucyfer the sterre 
Gladeth the morow / at his vprysing, 
So thoo ladies / at her In-comyng, 
With the stremës / of her eyën clere, 
Goodly apport / and wommanly manere, 
Contenaunce / and excellent fayrnesse, 
To alle the court / broghten In gladnesse. 
For the fresshnesse / of Her heuenly cheres 
So agreable was to the straun-gers, 
At her Entrè / that in especial 
hem thoght it lik a thyng Celestial; 
Enhastyng hem / in ful knyghtly wise 
ageynës hem / goodly to arise. 
And as they mette / with humble contenaunce, 
Ful konyngly / did her obseruaunce, 
Hem conveying / to her sitting-place.
But sothly I haue leyser non nor space 
To reherce / and put in remembraunce, 
Hooly the maner / of her daliaunce. 
It were to longe / for ȝou to abide. 
63
But wel I woot / that the god Cupide, 
By influence / of his myghty hond 
And the feruence / of his firy brond, 
Her metyng first / fortunëd hath so wel, 
That his arowes / of gold, and not of stiel, 
Ipercëd han / the knyghtës hertës tweyn, 
Thorgh the brest / with such a lusty peyn 
That ther abood / sharpe / as spere or launce, 
Depe yfichëd / the poynt of remembraunce, 
which may not / lightly / racëd ben away. 
And thus in Ioye / they dryvë forth þe day 
In Play and Reuel / for the knyghtës sake. 
And towardes nyght / they her chambres take 
At duë tyme / as her fader bad, 
And on her way / the knyghtës han hem lad 
Reuerently vp be many staire; 
Takyng lievë / gan anon repaire 
To her logging / in a ful statly toure, 
Assignëd hem / be the harberioure.
And after spicës / pleynly, and the wyn 
In Coppës gretë / wroght of gold ful fyn, 
With-oute tarying / to beddë streght they gon. 
Touchyng her reste /, wher thei slepte or non, 
Demeth ȝe louers / that in such maner thing 
Bexperience han fully knowlecchyng; 
64
For it is nat declarëd / in my boke.
But as I fyndë / the kyng al nyght woke, 
Thoghtful in herte / the story specifies, 
Musing sore / and ful of fantasies; 
First aduerting / þe gretë worthynesse 
Of this knyghtës / and the semlynesse, 
Her lusty ȝouth / her force / and her manhode, 
And how thei weren y-come of Royal blode. 
Al this he ganne / to reuolue aboute, 
Ay in his herte / hauyng a maner doute, 
A-twenë two / hangyng / in balaunce 
where he shuldë / maken an aliaunce 
A-twene his doghtren / and the knyghtës tweyn. 
For on thyng / ay / his hertë gan constreyn, 
The remembrance / of his avisioun, 
Of which to-forn / I madë mencioun, 
Touchyng / þe lyon / and the wilde boor, 
It nedeth nat / to reherce it mor, 
Casting alway / in his Fantasie, 
What it myghte / cleerly signyfie, 
This dirke dreme /; this was hid and cloos.
But on the morowe / Adrastus vp aroos, 
And to the temple / the riȝte way he took, 
And gan preie / deuoutly on his book 
To the goddes / his dreme to specefie. 
And they hym bad homward forto hye, 
And to beholde / in the knyghtës sheldys 
65
The fellë beestys / peynted in the feeldys; 
Which shal to hym /, be cleer inspeccioun, 
Ful pleynly / makë declaracioun 
Of his dreme / which he hadde in the nyght. 
And Adrastus / enhasted hym ful riȝt 
In her Sheldës wisly to beholde. 
Wher that he saugh / as the goddës tolde, 
In the Sheldës / hangyng vpon hokys, 
The beestës ragë / with her mortal lokys. 
And to purpos, lik as writ Bochas, 
Polymytë / ful streght enbracëd was 
In the hyde / of a feerce lyoun. 
And Tydeus / abouen his haberioun 
A Gypon haddë / hidous / sharpe and hoor, 
wroght of the bristels / of a wylde boor. 
The whichë beestis / as the story lerys,

Displaiëd broodë / whan they shulde fight. 
wherof the kyng / whan he hadde a sight 
Att hys repeir / in herte was ful glad, 
And with a facë / ful demur and sad 
with his lordes, that he about hym hadde, 
To the temple / he thys knyghtës ladde.
And whan they haddë / with all circumstaunces 
Of Rytys oldë / don her obseruaunces, 
66
Hom to the court / they resort ageyn. 
And in an hallë / riche and wel beseyn, 
This worthy kyng of herte lyberal, 
Made a feeste / solempne and Royal, 
Which in deyntees / surly dyd excelle. 
But it were veyn / euery cours to telle, 
her straungë sewës / and her sotyltees, 
Ne how they sat / lik to her degrees; 
For lak of tyme I lat it ouerslyde.
And after mete / Adrastus toke a-syde 
The knyghtës two / and lik a prudent man 
In sykrè wisë / thus his tale he gan.
“Sirs,” quod he / “I ne doute it nouȝt 
Þat it is fressh / and grene / ay in ȝour thoȝt 
How that first / by goddys ordynaunce, 
And after next / thorgh fatys purveaunce, 
And be workyng / of fortunës hond, 
How that ȝe werën brouȝt into this lond 
Bothë tweyn / But now this lastë nyght: 
Of whoos comyng / I am ful glad and light 
First in my-self /, shortly to expresse, 
whan I considre / and se the liklynesse 
Of ȝour personys / with the Circumstancys 
And hool the maner / of ȝour gouernancys; 
Seyng ful wel /, wherto shuld I feyne,

To grete estat / and habundaunce of good, 
Thorgh ȝoure birth / and ȝour Royal blood; 
Ȝe may not faylë / but ȝe hauë wrong, 
For ȝe are bothë manly / and right strong. 
And forto sette ȝoure hertës mor at reste 
My purpoos is / I hopë for the beste, 
So that in ȝou be no variance, 
To make a knotte / as be allyaunce, 
Atwixë ȝow and my doghtres two,

And for I am fully in dyspeyr 
To succedë for to han an heir, 
Therfor ȝe shal han possessioun, 
Duryng my lyf / of half this Regioun,

Ther is no man / that therto shal sey nay. 
And sothly after / whan that I am graue,

And by ȝour wit / ȝe shul the lond amend,

And for the daiës / passëd ben and gon

And whan Adrastus / hadde his talë fyned,

As he that was / a verray gentyl knyght, 
With al his power / and his fullë myght

And for his parte / seide he wolde assente

To all that euer the kyng haþ sayd. 
69
And Polymyte / was also wel apayd,

And so they ben / bothë / condescendyd 
The kynggës willë / to fulfille in dede 
From poynt to poynt / and ther-vpon procede,

And Tydeus / made / his brother chese, 
Of gentillesse and of curtesye,

And he in soth / chosen hath argyve,

And Tydeus / tok than Dëyphylee, 
Of her beautè / most souereyn excellent.
And Adrastus / thorgh-oute his lond hath sent 
For his lordës / and his baronage, 
To be present / at the mariage 
Of the knyghtës / and make no lettyng. 
And they echon . cam at his bidding, 
In goodly wysë / meke and ful benygne, 
Ageyn the day / that he dide assigne. 
And thyder cam ful many lusty knyght, 
Ful wel beseyn / and many lady briȝt, 
From euery Coost / and many frecssh sqwyer,

70
To byholde the gretë Ryaltè 
And the maner / of thys solempnytè.

Of Iustës / Reuel / and the dyuers daunces, 
The feestës riche /, and the gyftës grete, 
The pryvè sighës / and the feruent hete

By sotyl craft / leyd oute lyne and hokes, 
The Ialous folk / to traysshen and begyle

Al this in soth / descryven I ne can.
But wel wote I / the newë famë ran, 
This menë whilë / with ful swift passage

And by report trewe and not yfeyned, 
The soune therof the eerës hath atteyned, 
Myn auctour writ /, of Ethyocles, 
Touchyng thonour / and the gret encres 
Of Polymytë / heghly magnyfied, 
And how that he / newly was allyed 
With Adrastus / in the londe of Arge. 
The whiche thyng / he gretly gan to charge, 
71
Dredyng Inly / that this mariage 
Shal after turne / vnto his damage, 
Sorë musyng / and castyng vp and doun 
The grete pouer / and the hegh renoun 
Of Adrastus / the which of grekës land 
Hadde al the power / soget to his hand: 
Lest that he / for Polymytës sak 
wold vpon hym / a newë werrë make, 
But ȝif that he, lik the conuencioun, 
At tymë sette / delyuerëd the toun 
To his broder / by bond of oth I-sworn, 
Be couenauntes / assurëd her to-forn, 
Ȝif ȝe remembre / late as I ȝou told:

But from his heste / Caste forto varye. 
And ther-vp-on list no lenger tarye, 
Lich his desire / to shapë remedyes.
And first he sente for his next allies 
In whoom he haddë / most his affiaunce, 
For his lordës / that hadde gouernaunce 
Of his kyngdom / to come to hym anon. 
And whan they werën present euerichon, 
he seidë pleynly /, wenyng for his best, 
That his hert / shal neuer lyve in rest, 
But in sorowe / and in a maner drede, 
72
Tyl his brother / outrely be dede; 
That he in Thebës / in his Royal sete

Vnperturbed / of Polymyte his brother.
And at this counsayl / diuers of entent,

Some in soth / that feithful were and trewe, 
And some also / that can chaunge of newe, 
And other ek / that be-twixë tweyn

The firste seide, abouen allë thyng 
Comendacioun of Trouthe.

Trouthë shuldë / longë to a kyng, 
Of his word / not be variable, 
But pleyn / and hool / as a Centre stable.
For trouthë first / with-outen eny wene, 
Is Chief Pyler / that may a kyng sustene, 
Nota.

In Ioye and honour / for to lede his lyff. 
how trouth is preferred in the book of Esdre / aforn kyngges / wymmen and wyn.

For trouth whilom / hadde a prerogatiff, 
As of Esdre / the book can specyfie, 
Record I take / of Prudent Neemye, 
That worthy kyngges / for al her grete pride, 
Wyn / and wymmen / ben ek set a-syde, 
73
With all her pouer / and domynacioun, 
havyng reward / in comparisoun 
To trouthës myght / and trouthës worthynesse. 
For as Esdre / pleynly / doth expresse, 
Who taketh hede /, in the samë place, 
Be the Influencë / sothly / and the grace 
Of trouthe allon / this oldë Neemye 
Gat hym licencë / to rëedifie 
The wallys newe / of Ierusalem. 
Which trouth is tresour / chief of euery rewme, 
For Salamon writ / how that thyngës tweyne,
Trouth and mercye preseruen a kyng from al aduersyte.


Trouth / and mercy / lynkëd in a cheyne, 
Preserve a kyng / lik to his degrè, 
From al meschief / and aduersitè. 
Allas therfor / that eny doublenesse, 
Chaunge nor doublenesse shal not be in a kyng.


Variaunce or vnsicrenesse, 
Chaunge of word / or mutabilitè, 
fraude / or deceyte / or vnstabiletè, 
Shuld in a kyng / han domynacioun, 
To causen after / his destruccioun. 
Of kynggës / redeth the story doune be rowe, 
And seth / how many / han ben ouerthrowe 
Thorgh her falshede / fro fortunes whel. 
For vnto god / it pleseth neuer a del, 
A kyng to ben / double of entent; 
For it may happë / that the world is blent 
74
Ful oftë sith / be sleght of her werkyng.
But this the trouthë / god seeþ euery thyng 
Right as it is / for ther may be no cloude 
To-forn his sight / trouthë forto shrowde.
It may be clipsed / and derkëd be disceyte, 
By fals engyne / liggyng in a-weyte, 
As a serpent / forto vndermyne; 
But at the last / it wol clerly shyne, 
Who that seith nay /, shew his briȝte bemes. 
For it in soth / of kyngdames and of Reawmes 
Is berer vp / and conseruatrice 
From al Meschief / sothfast mediatrice 
To god abouë / who so list to se, 
To kepe a kyng / in Prosperitè 
On euery side / as I afferme dar.
For which ȝe kyngges and lordës beth wel war 
Ȝour bihestës / Iustly forto holde! 
And thenk how Thebës / with his wallës olde 
Distroiëd was / platly / this no les, 
For doublenesse / of Ethiocles, 
Which his puple / after sore abouht: 
Only for he nat by counsell wroght 
Of hem that wern / bothe trewe and wis: 
75
hym lyst nat worchen / after her devys; 
But lefte trouthe / and sette his fantasye 
To be gouernëd / by fals flaterye,
That bad hym thenkë / how he was a knyght, 
the counsayl of Flatareres.


And to holde of forcë /, morë than of right, 
Duryng his lyf / lordship of the toun, 
And not to lesë his possessioun 
For no bond / nor heestës mad toforn; 
But lete his brother / blowën in an horn, 
Wher that hym lyst / or pypen in a red. 
This was the counsail / platly and þe Reed 
Of swich as liste nat / to seyn the soth, 
But falsly flater / with her wordës smoth.
And whan they haddë / hool her talë fyned, 
Ethyocles / fully is enclynyd, 
Who so euer ther-at / laugh or wepe, 
lik her counsayl . possessioun to kepe, 
who that sey nay / or gruche ther-ageyn; 
hym to contrarye / he thoght was but veyn. 
How the ȝeer was come out that Ethiocles regnyd.


But in this whylë hath the shenë sonne 
The tweluë signës / round aboutë Ronne 
Sith Ethiocle / be Iust rekenyng, 
In Thebës was crownëd / lord and kyng, 
holdyng the sceptre / and the dyademe; 
That be resoun / as it wolde seme, 
The tymë was ful complet / and the space, 
76
Of couenaunte / he shulde voide his place, 
And Polymytë ek / his iournè make 
Toward Thebës /, pocessioun to take 
Of duë title / But he haddë wronge: 
Which thoght in soth / the ȝeer was wonder longe 
Of his Exil / er it kam aboute.
And for he hadde / in hert a manere doute 
Lest in his broder / ther wer falshed found 
Taquyte hym-silf / lik as he was bound,
To Adrastus / he gan declar his herte, 
Beseching hym / this mater to aduerte, 
And ther-vpon / to ȝiue a counsayl sone, 
Touchyng his right / what was best to done, 
wher it was bet to gon / or to abyde, 
Or liche a knyght manfully to Ryde 
hym-silf allone / and makë no massage, 
For to Chalaunge / his rightful heritage 
with-Inne Thebës / outher be pees or stryf, 
And ther-vpon / to Iuparte his lif. 
Thus was he set / for al his fercë brother.
But Adrastus / sothly / thoght a-nother 
Bet was to sendë / than hym-silf to gon 
Lest he were trapped among his mortal fon; 
Havyng his brother / suspecte in this cas 
That be fraude / or be some fallas, 
He woldë werk / to his destruccioun, 
77
Ȝif he wer hardye to entren in-to toun. 
For which he bad hym / prudently tak hede, 
Ful concludyng / how it was mor spede 
That some other be / to Thebës sent, 
To apparceyvë fully the entent
Of Ethiocle / outward / be some signe, 
And wher that he / his crounë wil resigne 
For thilke ȝeer /, lik as he made his ooth: 
And whan he knewe / how his purpoos goþ 
Ther-vpon to werken / and procede.
Thus Adrastus / wisely gan hym rede.
And whil they trete / vpon this matere, 
Tydeus with a manly chere 
Tydeus took vpon hym to don þe massage of Polymyte.


Saide vttrely / for his broder sake, 
This massagë / he wold vndertake 
with hool thempris / of thenbassyat, 
wer it wilful / or infortunat: 
He wil not sparë / what so that betide.
But Adrastus / on the toþer syde, 
And Polymyte / in conclusioun, 
Weren contrarye / to that opynyoun, 
And seidë sothly / as hem thoghte right, 
Sith that he was / so wel / a preuëd knyght 
And discended of so worthy blood, 
78
That they nolde / for non erthly good, 
For all Thebës / with the regalye, 
Put his body / in such Iupartie.
But all this thyng / auaylëd hem riȝt noȝt; 
For he wol forth / how dere that it be boȝt, 
Takyng lievë / first of all thestatys, 
And armëd hym in Mayle / and surë platys, 
And Shope hym forth / vpon his Iournè. 
The sorowe of Deyphile whan Tideus went toward Thebes.

who madë sorowe / but Dëyphylë, 
with bitter teerës / dewëd al her face, 
Ful ofte sith / swownyng in the place, 
Trist and mournyng / in her blakë wede, 
Whan she saugh / that he took his stede; 
So inwardly gan encres her mone, 
Seyng her lord / so ridë forth allone 
Vpon his way / this worthy Tydeus.
And in al hast, the story telleth vs, 
He spedde hym so, makyng no delayes, 
That in space / of a fewe daies 
The heghe toures of Thebës / he gan se, 
And entred is / into the Citè, 
Wisly enqueryng / wher the Paleys stood; 
And lik a knyght / thidere streght he rood, 
Markyd ful wel / in many mannys sight, 
lich Mars / hym-silf /, in stiel y-armëd bright, 
Til he atteynëd hath the chief dongoun, 
wher as the kyng / helde his mancyoun. 
And thorgh the paleys / with a knyghtly look 
Into the hall / the righte way he took, 
79
From his stedë / whan he lighte doun, 
Not afered / but hardy as lyoun, 
Wher as the kyng / with lordës a gret route 
In the hallë sittyng / rounde aboute, 
he entred Inne / most manful of corage, 
To execute / the fyn of his massage. 
And as hym thouȝt / conuenient and due 
Ful konnyngly / he gan the kyng salue 
Requiring hym /, of kyngly excellence, 
In goodly wise / to ȝeve hym audience, 
And not disdeyne / neither in port ne cheer, 
Sith he was Come / as a massagere 
From Polymyte / his ownë brodere dere; 
Gynnyng his talë / thus, as ȝe shal here. 
“Sir,” quod he, “vnto ȝour worthynesse 
My purpoos is breefly to expresse 
Theffecte only, as in sentement, 
how wisly and how knyghtly


Of the massagë why that I am sent. 
Tideus did his massage.


It were in veyn / longe processe forto make. 
But of my mater / the verrey ground to take, 
In eschewyng of prolixitè, 
And voyde away / al superfluytè, 
Sith ȝoure-silf best ought to vnderstond 
The causë fully / that we han on hond, 
And ek conceyve / þentent of my menynge, 
Of rightwisnessë / longgyng to a kynge: 
First considred /, ȝif that ȝe tak hede, 
80
whan Edippus / the oldë kyng was dede, 
how that ȝour-silf / and ȝoure brother blyve 
For the croune / contagiously gan stryve 
As mortal foon / by ful gret hatrede, 
which of ȝow two / shulde first succede: 
Til that ȝe were / be meenys reconcyled, 
Ȝe to regne / and he to be exiled 
Out of this towne / for a ȝeerës space, 
And than ageyn / resorte to his place, 
To regne as kyng, and ȝe to voyden oute, 
So as ȝour tourne / be processe kam aboute; 
Euerich of ȝow / paciently tendure 
Thenterchaungyng / of his Auenture, 
Who were put out / or stood in his estat, 
Ther-vpon to makë no debat, 
Lich the Couenaunt / and conuencioun, 
Enrollëd vp / by lordys of this toun, 
Which of reson may not be denyed. 
The request þat Tideus mad in þe name of Polymyt vnder the title of þe Conuencioun.

And sith ȝe han / a ȝeer / y-occupied,
Polimytës / requereþ ȝow of riȝt, 
Taqwite ȝou / lik a trewë knyght, 
In eschewyng of mortal werre and strif; 
Sith ȝe han had / a Prerogatif 
As eldest brother / forto regne aforn: 
And thenketh eke / how that ȝe ar sworn 
ȝour oth to kepe / and make no tarying, 
Holy aduerting / lich a prudent kyng, 
That trouth is mor / in conparisoun, 
81
Than all the tresour / of ȝour Regyoun, 
Mor acceptable / vnto god and man

Wherefor in hast / and lat ther be no slouthe,

And lat hym regnen / in his Ryaltè,

Than wol al Grecë / preise and magnyfie

But ȝe han quytt ȝou / Iustly to ȝour brother. 
This hool theffecte / of al that I wil seyn,

Whan Tydeus / haddë told his tale,

Dyssimulyng / vnder colour feyned, 
Shewyng a cheer / in maner debonayre, 
To his entent / wonderly contrayre, 
Inward in hertë / wood and furious, 
Turnyng his facë / towarde Tydeus, 
he gan abraid / and at the last out-brak, 
The answer of Ethiocles.


And euen thus / vnto hym he spak.
“I haue gret mervaile /” quod he, “in my thoght 
Of the massagë / which that thow hast broght,

Of verrey scorn, Rooted in his herte;

Whan Tydeus / hadde his massagë saide,

As he that list / no lenger / ther soiourne, 
Fro the kyng / he gan his facë tourne, 
Nat astouned / nor in his hert afferde; 
But ful proudly / leyde hond on his swerde, 
How manly Tydeus departe[d] from þe kyng.


88
And in despit / who that was lief or loth, 
A sternë pas / thorgh the halle he goth, 
Thorgh-out the courte / and manly took his stede, 
And out of Thebës / faste gan hym spede, 
Enhastyng hym / til he was at large, 
And sped hym forth / touard the londe of arge.
Thus leue I hym / ridë forth a while, 
whilys that I retourne ageyn my style 
Vnto the kyng which in the hallë stood 
Among his lordës / furious and wood, 
In his hertë / wroth / and euel apayd 
Of the wordes that Tydeus had said; 
Specialy / havyng remembraunce 
On the proude dispitous diffiaunce 
Whilys that he sat in his Royal See; 
Vpon which he wil auengëd be 
Ful cruelly, what euere that befalle. 
And in his Irë / he gan to hym calle

Chargyng hym / fastë for to hye

In al hast Tydeus to swe

With-oute mercy / anon that he be dede. 
And of knyghtës / fyfty weren in nombre,

Armed echon in mayle and thikkë stiel, 
And ther-with-al // yhorsëd wonder wiel. 
At a Posterne / forth they gan to ryde 
How falsly Ethyocles leyde a busshment in the way to haue slayn Tydeus.


By a geynpath / that ley oute a-side, 
Secrely / that no man hem espie, 
Only of tresoun / and of felonye. 
They haste hem forth / al the longë day, 
Of cruel malys / forto stoppe his way, 
Thorgh a forest / all of on assent, 
Ful couartly to leyn a busshement 
Vnder an hill / at a streite passage, 
To falle on hym at mor auauntage, 
The samë way / that Tydeus gan drawe, 
At thylke mount / wher that Spynx was slawe. 
He nothing war / in his opynyoun, 
Of this conpassëd / conspiracioun, 
But Innocent / and lich a gentyl knyght, 
Rood ay forth / til that it drowe to nyght, 
Sool by hym-silf / with-outë companye, 
havyng no man / to wisse hym or to gye.
But at the laste / liftyng vp his hede, 
90
Toward Euë / he gan taken hede; 
Mid of his way . riȝt as eny lyne, 
þoght he saugh / ageyn þe monë shyne 
Sheldës fressh / and platës bornëd bright, 
The which environ / casten a gret lyght; 
ymagynyng / in his fantasye 
How Tydeus outrayed fifty knyghtes þat lay in a-wayt for hym.

Ther was treson / and conspiracye 
wrought by the kyng / his iournè forto lette.
And of al that / he no thyng ne sette, 
But wel assurëd / in his manly herte, 
list nat onys / a-sydë to dyuerte, 
But kepte his way /, his sheld vpon his brest, 
And cast his sperë / manly in the rest. 
And the firste platly / that he mette, 
Thorgh the body / proudely he hym smette, 
That he fille ded . chief mayster of hem all; 
And than at onys / they vpon hym falle 
On euery part / be compas envyroun. 
But Tydeus / thorgh his hegh renoun,

Sleth and kylleth / vpon euery side 
In his Ire and his mortal tene, 
That mervaile was he myghte so sustene 
Ageyn hem all / in euery half besette. 
But his swerde was so sharpë whette, 
91
That his foomen fonde ful vnsoote. 
But he, allas! / was mad / alight a-foote, 
Be forcë grounded in ful gret distresse; 
But of knyghthod and of gret prouesse 
Vp he roos, maugrè all his foon, 
And as they cam, he slogh hem oon be on, 
lik a lyoun / rampaunt in his rage. 
And on this hille / he fond a narow passage, 
which that he took / of ful high prudence; 
And liche a boor stondyng at his diffence, 
As his foomen / proudly hym assaylle, 
vpon the pleyn / he made her blode to Raylle 
Al enviroun, that the soyl wex rede, 
Now her now ther / as they fillë dede, 
That her lay on / and ther lay two or thre. 
So mercyles / in his crueltè 
Thilke day he was vpon hem founde.
And attonys / his enemyes to confounde, 
wher as he stood / this myghty champioun, 
Be side he saugh / with water turnëd doun, 
An hugë ston / largë / rounde and squar; 
And sodeynly / er that thei wer war, 
As it haddë leyn / ther for the nonys, 
Vpon his foon / he rollëd it at onys, 
That ten of hem / wenten vnto wrak, 
92
And the remnaunt amasëd drogh a-bak; 
For on / by on / they wente to meschaunce. 
And fynaly / he broghte to outraunce 
Hem euerychon / Tydeus, as blyve, 
That non but on / was left of hem alyue;

Thurgh his harneys / bledyng on the grene. 
The theban knyghtes / in compas rounde aboute

For non of hem, shortly, myght eskape, 
But dede echon / as thei han deserued, 
Saue on excepte / the which was reserued 
By Tydeus / of intencioun, 
To the kyng / to make relacioun 
how his knyghtes / han on her iournè sped, 
Euerich of hem / his lyf left for a wed, 
And at the metyng / how they han hem born: 
To tellen al / he surëd was and sworn 
To Tydeus / ful lowly on his kne.
By which ensample / ȝe opynly may se 
Ageynës trouthë / falshed hath no myght. 
Fy on querilis / nat grounded vpon riȝt, 
93
with-outë which / may be no victorye. 
Therfor ech man / haue this in memorye, 
That gret pouer / shortly to conclude, 
Plentè of good / nor mochë multitude,

Arn to feble / to holden Chanpartye 
Ageynës trouthë / who that list take hede. 
For at the ende falshede may not spede 
Tendurë longe / ȝe shul fynde it thus. 
Record I take of worthy Tydeus, 
which with his hand / thorgh trouthës excellence, 
Fyfty knyghtës / slogh in his dyffence, 
But on except / as I late tolde, 
Sworn and assurëd with his honde vpholde, 
The kyng tenformë / how they wern atteynt.
And Tydeus, of bledyng wonder feynt, 
Maat and wery / and in gret distresse, 
And ouerleyd / of verray feblenesse; 
But as he myght / hym-siluë tho sustene, 
He took his hors / stondyng on the grene, 
Worthëd vp / and forth he gan to ryde 
An esy pas / with his woundës wyde. 
And Sothly / ȝit in his opynyoun 
he was alway / afferëd of tresoun. 
But anguysshous / and ful of bysy peyne 
He rode hym forth / til he did atteyne 
Into the boundës / of lygurgus lond, 
A worthy kyng / and manly of his hond. 
94
And he ful paal / only for lak of blood, 
Tydeus saugh / wher / a castel stood, 
How Tydeus, al forwounded, cam into ligurgus lond.

Strong and myghty / belt vpon a roche, 
Touard which / he faste gan approche, 
Conveyëd thider / be clernesse of the ston, 
That be nyght ageyn the moonë shon, 
On heghë toures / with crestës marcyal. 
And Ioyneaunt / almost to the wal 
was a gardyn / lityl out be syde, 
Into which / Tydeus gan ride, 
Of aventurë / be a gatë smal. 
And ther he fond / forto rekne al, 
A lusty herbere / vnto his devis, 
Soote and fressh / lich a paradys, 
Verray heuenly / of inspeccioun.
And first of al / he alyghte doun, 
The goodly placë / whan that he byheld, 
And fro his nek / he voyded hath his sheld, 
Drogh the brydyl / from his horses hede, 
let hym goon /, and took no maner hede, 
Thorgh the gardyn / that enclosëd was, 
Hym to pasture / on the grenë gras. 
95
And Tydeus / mor hevie than is led, 
Vpon the herbës / grenë, whit, and red, 
As hym thoughte / that tyme for the best 
he leid hym doune / forto tak his rest, 
Of werynessë / desirous to slepe, 
And non awayt / his body forto kepe; 
And with dremës / grocchëd euer among, 
Ther he lay / til the larkë song 
with notës newë / hegh vp in the ayr, 
The gladë morowe / rody and right fayr, 
Phebus also, casting vp his bemes, 
The heghë hyllës / gilte with his stremes, 
The syluer dewe / vpon the herbës rounde; 
Ther Tydeus lay vpon the ground, 
At the vprist / of the shenë svnne, 
And stoundëmele / his grenë woundës rvnne 
Round about / that the soyl was depeynt 
Hou Ligurgus doghter fond Tydeus sleping in the herber, al forwounded.


Of the grenë / with the redë meynt.
And euery morowe / for hoolsomnesse of eyre, 
Lygurgus doghter / makëd her repeyr, 
Of custom ay / among the flourës newe 
In this gardyn / of many dyuerse hwe, 
Swich Ioyë haddë /, forto taken hede, 
On her stalkës / forto sen hem sprede, 
In the Allurës / walking to and fro.
And whan she hadde a litil whilë goo 
96
her-self allonë / casting vp her sight, 
She byheld / wher an armëd knyght 
lay to rest hym / on the herbës colde; 
And hym besydë / she gan ek byholde 
his myghty stedë / walkyng her and ther. 
And she anon / fille in a maner fer, 
Speceally whan she saugh the blood 
Sprad al the grene / aboute ther she stood.
But at the laste / she kaught hardynesse, 
And wommanly / gan her forto dresse 
Toward this knyght, havyng a manere drede 
And gret doute lest that he were dede. 
And of her willë / sothly this was chief, 
That she thoughte forto mak a prief 
how that it stood / of this man, ful ofte.
And forth she gooth / and touchëd hym ful softe, 
Ther as he lay / with her hondes smale. 
And with a facë dedly / bleyk, and pale, 
lich as a man adawëd / in a swogh, 
Vp he stert / and his swerd he drogh, 
Nat fully out / but put it vp ageyn 
Anon as he hath the lady seyn, 
Beseching hir / only of her grace, 
To han pitè / vpon his trespace, 
And rewe on hym of her wommanhede. 
For of affray / he was falle in drede 
lest he hadde / assaylëd ben of newe 
Of the thebans / preuëd ful vntrewe; 
97
For dred of which he was so rekkëles, 
Ful humblely / hym ȝelding to the pes, 
Tryst in hym-silf / he passëd hadde his boundes.
And whan that she saugh his mortal woundes, 
She haddë routh / of verrey gentyllesse 
Of his desese / and of his distresse, 
And bad he shulde / no-thing be dismayd, 
Nor in herte sorouful nor affrayd, 
Disconfort hym in no maner thing. 
“For I,” quod she / “am doghter to the kyng, 
Callyd lygurge / which gretly me delyte 
Euery morowe / this gardyn to visyte; 
It is to me so passingly disport.” 
How wommanly the lady acquyt hir to Tydeus in his desese.


“Wherfor,” quod she / “beth of good comfort; 
For no wight her / touchyng ȝour viage, 
Shal hynder ȝou / nor do ȝow no damage. 
And ȝif ȝe list / of al ȝour auenture 
The pleynë trouth / vnto me discure, 
I wil in soth / do my bysynesse 
To reforme / ȝoure greuous hevynesse 
with al my myght / and hool my dylygence; 
That I hope of ȝoure gret offence 
ȝe shal han helpe in ȝour aduersitè. 
And, as ferforth / as it lith in me, 
98
Trusteth right wel / ȝe shul no fautë fynde.”
And whan he saugh / that she was so kynde, 
So wommanly / so goodly, and benygne 
In al her poort / be many dyuers signe, 
He vnto hir / be ordre wold not spare 
his auenturis / fully to declare, 
In Thebës first touching his massage, 
And at the hil / of the woodë Rage, 
Of his woundës / and his hurtës sore 
(It were but veyn / to reherce it mor) 
Hou Tydeus was refresshed in the castel of the lady.

By and by he told her euery del, 
The which in soth / she likëd neuere a del, 
But haddë routh and compassioun 
Of his meschief / wroght be fals tresoun: 
Byddyng in hast / that he shuld hir swe, 
And wommanly /, as her thoghte dwe, 
To a chambre / she ladde hym vp alofte, 
Ful wel beseyn /, ther-in a bed right softe 
Richëly abouten apparayled 
With cloth of gold /, al the floor yrayled 
Of the samë / both in length and brede.
And first this lady / of her wommanhede, 
hir wymmen badde / as goodly as they kan, 
To be attendaunt on this wounded man. 
And whan he was vnarmëd to his sherte, 
99
She madë first wassh his woundës smerte, 
And serche hem wel / with dyuers instrumentes, 
And madë fette / sondry oynëmentes, 
And leches ek / the beste she koude fynde, 
Ful craftëly to staunche hem / and to bynde. 
And euery thing / that may do hym ease 
Taswage his peyn / or his woo tapese, 
Was in the courte / and in the Castel sought, 
And by her byddyng / to his chambre brought. 
And for his sakë / she hath after sent 
For swich deyntees / as wern conuenyent, 
Moost nutrityf / be phisikës lore, 
hem that wern syk / or wounded / to restore, 
Makyng her wymmen / ek to taken kep 
And wayt on hym / anyghtës whan he slep, 
And be wel war / that no thing asterte 
That was or myght be / lusty to his herte.
And with al this / she preiëd hym abyde 
Til he were strong / and myghty forto ride, 
In the castel to pley hym / and disporte, 
And at leysere / hom ageyn resorte 
whan he myght bywelde hym at his large.
But al for nought /: he wil hom to Arge, 
Toke his lyeve on the nexte day, 
With-out abood / to hast hym on his way, 
lowly thonkyng / vnto her goodnesse 
100
Of her fredam / and bountëvous largesse, 
So wommanly that hir list taken hede 
Hym to refressh in his grete nede, 
Beheestyng hir / with al his fullë myght, 
He woldë be hir seruaunt / and hir knyght, 
Whyl he leueth, of what she wold hym charge.
Hou Tydeus repeyred hym to Arge al forwoundyd.

And forth he rood / til he cam to Arge 
In ful gret hast / and woldë nowher dwelle. 
But what shuld I rehercen owther telle 
Of his repeir / the coostës or the pleyns, 
The craggy Roches / or the hegh mounteyns, 
Or al the maner / of his hoom-commynge, 
Of the metyng / or the welcomynge, 
Nor the Ioyë / that Adrastus made, 
Nor how his sustre / and his wif were glade? 
Nor how that they /, wherto shuld I write, 
Enbracëd hym / in her Armës white, 
Nor the gadryng / about hym / and the pres 
Nor of the sorowe / that Polymytës 
Mad in hym-silf / to sen hym so forwounded, 
his greuous hurtes / his soorys / ek vnsounded, 
His dedly look / and his facë pale? 
(Of alle this / to gynne a newë tale 
It were in soth / a maner ydylnesse) 
101
Nor how hym-silf in ordre did expresse 
First how that he in Thebës hath hym born, 
Nor how the kyng / falsly was forsworn, 
Nor of the awayt / nor tresoun that he sette, 
whan fyfty knyghtës / on the way hym mette, 
As ȝe han herd / al the manere howe, 
With-oute which / my tale is long ynowe.
But Adrastus / madë men to seche 
In euery Coost / for many diuerse leche, 
To come in hast / and make no tarying, 
Vpon a peyne / be biddyng of the kyng, 
To don her craft / that he wer recured 
And of his force / in euery part assured. 
And they echon / so her konnyng shewe 
That, in space / of a daiës fewe, 
He was al hool / maad of his siknesse. 
Tho was ther Ioye / and tho was ther gladnesse 
Thorgh-out the courte / and thorgh-out al the toun. 
For euery man / hath swich opynyoun 
In Tydeus / for his gentyllesse, 
For his manhood and his lowlynesse, 
That he was holde / the moste famous knyght 
And best byloued / in euery mannys sight 
Thorgh-oute grece / in euery Regioun.
But now most I / make a digressioun, 
To tellë shortly / as in Sentement, 
Of thilke knyght / that Tydeus hath sent 
Into Thebës / only to declare 
The grete meschief / and the euel fare 
102
Vnto the kyng / how it is befalle, 
The opyn trouth / of his knyghtës alle, 
how Tideus hath slayn hem euerychon, 
That, sauf hym-silf / ther eskapëd non: 
which was reserued / from sheding of his blood, 
The kyng to tellë pleynly how it stood. 
And whan he hadde rehersëd euery poynt, 
Ethiocles stood / in such disioynt 
Of hatful Irë that he wex nye wood. 
And in his tene / and his fellë mood, 
Of cruel malys / to the knyght he spak, 
And felly seidë / that it was for lak 
Only of manhood / thorgh her cowardys, 
How Ethiocles was asstonyed whan he herd þe deth of his knyghtes.

That thei wern slayn / in so mortal wyse. 
“And hangëd be he / highë by the nekke 
That of ȝour deth / or of ȝour slaughter Rekke, 
Or ȝou compleyn / outher on or all, 
Of the meschief / that is ȝowe befall. 
I do no force / that non of ȝou asterte. 
But fye vpon ȝour falsë couard herte, 
That on kynght hath, thorgh his hegh renoun, 
Brought ȝow all into confusioun, 
Ful gracëles / and ful vnhappy to.”
“Nay,” quod this knyght, “it is no-thing so. 
103
It is thyn vnhappe / pleynly, and not oures, 
That so many worthy werreoures, 
Which al her lif / neuer haddë shame, 
Except this quarel / taken in thy name, 
That grounded was / and rooted on falssenesse: 
This was cause / in verray sikernesse,

And the vntrouthë / don vnto thy brother, 
And that thow were / so opynly forsworn: 
A parcel causë why that we wer lorn

And tho the kyng / almost mad for wroth, 
In purpoos was forto slee this knyght, 
Oonly for he seidë to hym right, 
The which allas / both at eue and morowe, 
Supprisëd was / with a dedly sorowe, 
Renewëd ay, in his remembraunce, 
With the pitous / and vnhappy chaunce 
Of the meschief / and mysauenture, 
Touching the deth / and disconfiture 
Of his feeres / and of hym-silf also: 
That the shamfast / in-portable wo 
So frat on hym / with such a mortal stryf 
That he was wery / of his ownë lif; 
Hent a swerd / and a-sidë sterte, 
And rove hym-silf euen to the herte,
104
The kyng hym-silf / beyng tho present; 
That the rumour / and the noys is went 
Thorgh-outë Thebës / of the woodë rage, 
Be swich as werën / Ioynëd by lynage 
To the knyghtës / slayën at the hille; 
That all atonys / of oon herte and wille,

Vpon the kyng / avengëd forto be, 
Which of her deth / was chief occasioun.
But the barouns / and lordës of the toun 
Ful busy wern / this Rumour to dysesse, 
Of high prudence / to stynten and appese, 
In quyete / euery thyng to sette.
And after that the bodyes hom they fette 
Of the kynghtës / lik as ȝe han herde,

Of Tydeus / ful sharpë whet and grounde. 
And in the felde / so as they hem founde, 
Only of loue / and affeccioun, 
Solempnëly they broght hem into toun. 
And, lik the maner / of her rytis olde, 
They weren first brent / into Asshes colde, 
Euerich buryed / lich to his degrè.

In al the hast possible / that they may, 
And to retourne / in their best aray, 
At termë sette, ful manly to be seyn,

To-forn Argë / mostren in a pleyn.
And as I rede / ful worthy of degrè

The which was, be recorde of wryting, 
Of Archada / sonë to the kyng.
And ful prudent found in werre and pees 
Ther came also / the kyng Cylmythenës.
And as I fynde / ful famous of renoun 
Thyder cam ek / the kyng ypemedoun.
And passing all / of knyghthode and of name, 
And excellyng / by worthynesse of fame, 
The noble kyng / callyd Campaneus, 
kam ek to Argë / the story telleth vs, 
Prouëd ful wel / and haddë ryden ferre.
And thider kam the kyng Melleager,
Kyng Genor ek / that helde his Royal sete, 
Myn Autour seiþ / in the lond of Crete;
Kyng Laëris and the kyng Pyrrus, 
The kyngges and princes that cam with Adrastus.

And ek the kyng / callëd Tortolanus. 
And renomed in many regyoun 
109
Ther cam the kyng / ynamëd palemoun, 
Oft assayed / and found a manly knyght, 
That with hym broght / in steel y-armëd bright, 
Ful many worthy / out of his cuntrè.
And Tideus / most knyghtly forto se, 
That manly man / that noble werreyour, 
As he that was / of worthynessë flour, 
Maister and myrour / by prouesse of his hond, 
hath sent also into the myghty lond 
Of Calcedoyne / of which he was hayr, 
That is a kyngdam / bothë riche and fayr, 
Chargyng his counsale / and officers also, 
In al the hast / that it may be do, 
To seken out / the beste werreyours, 
Of famous knyghtes / and preuëd sawdyours, 
Thorgh al the lond / and layde on hem this charge 
With-oute aboode / forto come to arge. 
And they obeye / ful lowly his biddyng, 
Enhastyng hem / and madë no lettyng, 
But spedde hem fast / vppon her iournè.
And fro Thebës / the myghty strong Citè, 
kam doune knyghtes / with many another man, 
Maugrè the kyng / to helpë what they Can, 
Considred first / his falshed and tresoun, 
Ymeued only / of trouth and of resoun,
110
Polymytës / as they were sworn of ȝore, 
To his Croune / Iustly to restore: 
And whan they weren at large out of the toun, 
Vnto Argë / they be descendid doun, 
And, lik her oth / and her assuraunce, 
As they wern bounde / only of lygeaunce, 
To hym they Cam / in ful lowly wise, 
Redy to don / what hym list devise.
And whan he hadde / her trouthë ful conceyued, 
He hath to gracë / goodly hem receyued, 
Assignyng hem / her placë mydde the hoste, 
Assembled ther / from many diuerse coste: 
That fynaly / in this companye 
ygadred was / the floure of Chyvalrye 
Ychosen out of al grekës lond 
The most knyghtly / and manful of her hond: 
That I trowë, sith the world began, 
Ther was not seyn / so many manly man, 
So wel horsëd / with sper and with sheld, 
To-gydre assembled / sothly, in a feld.
Ther men may see many straungë guyses 
Of Armyng newe / and vncouth devyses, 
Euery man / after his fantasye; 
That ȝif I shuld / in ordre specifie 
Euery pes / longyng to armure, 
And ther-vpon / do my bysy cure, 
It wer in soth / almost a dayës werk; 
111
And the termës also ben to derk, 
To reherce hem clerly and to Ryme: 
I passe ouer / only for lak of tyme.
And telle I wil / forth of her loggyng, 
How Adrastus / the noble worthy kyng, 
Hath euery lord / lik to his degrè, 
Receyuëd wel / with-Innen his Cytè: 
And ther they haddë / lik to her plesaunce, 
Of what nedeth / fulsom habundaunce, 
For man and hors / plentè of Vitaylle; 
Comaundyng / that no thyng ne faylle 
That alle thise noble worthy werreoures, 
Both high and lough . and poorë soudeoures, 
Iseruëd weren of that they haddë nede. 
For Adrastus / prudently took hede, 
What vayleth a kyng to payen his puple trewly her sowde.


Ful lik a kyng / touching her termë-day, 
That thei to-forn / wer seruëd of her pay. 
He was so free / hym list no thyng restreyn; 
And no man haddë causë to compleyn 
For hunger / thrust / nor for Indygence.
And in a prince / it is ful gret offence, 
As clerkës seyn / and a gret repreef, 
Suffre his puple / lyven at mescheef. 
It is ful hevy / and greuous in her thoght 
Ȝif he habound / and they han right noght. 
he may not both / possedë good and herte, 
He to be riche / and Seen his puple smerte. 
112
He may the body / of power wel constreyne, 
But her hertë / hath a ful long Reyne, 
Maugrè his myght / to louen at her large. 
Ther may no kyng / on hertës sette a charge, 
Nor hem coarten / from her lybertè. 
Men seyn ful oftë / how that thouht is fre. 
For which eche princë / lord / and gouernour, 
And specialy euery Conquerour, 
Lat hym be war / for al his hegh noblesse, 
That bountè, Fredom / plentè, and largesse, 
Be on accord / that they his brydel lede, 
Lest of his puple / whan he hath most nede, 
He be defrauded / ; whan he is but allone, 
Than is to latë forto make his mone. 
But in his courte / lat hym first devise 
To exile scarshed and couetise; 
Hou Loue Vayleþ mor a kyng than gold or gret richesse.

Than is he likly / with fredam ȝif he gynne, 
loue of his puple / euermore to wynne, 
To regnë long in honure, and contune 
Ay to encresse / be fauour of fortune, 
And his ennemyes manly to oppresse. 
For loue is mor / than gold or gret richesse; 
Gold faileth oftë / louë wol abyde 
113
For lyf or deth / be a lordys syde; 
And the tresour / shortly, of a kyng 
Stondeth in loue / abouen allë thyng. 
Farwel lordshipe / bothë morowe and Eve 
Specially / whan louë taketh his leve! 
And who so list / a merour forto make 
Of kyngly fredam / lat hym ensample take 
Of Adrastus / the manly kyng famous, 
So liberal and so bountevous 
Vnto his puple / at al tymës found: 
Which mad hym strong / his foomen to confound; 
And loue only / his enmyes to werreye, 
Alle grecë made his bidding to obeye, 
Of oon accord / knyghtly be his side, 
Al attones / to Thebës forto ryde, 
For tavengë / sith they were so strong, 
The gret Iniurye / and the inportable wrong 
Don to his sone / and his next allye, 
As ȝe to-forn / han herd me specifie.
But whilë Grekës / rest a whil in pees, 
I will resort / vnto Ethiocles: 
which in Thebës warly hath espied, 
Be his frendes / as he was certefied, 
Of the Grekys / hooly the ordinaunce, 
Her purpoos ek / and her purueaunce, 
And therof had in herte a manere drede. 
And first he took his counsayle and his rede 
114
Of the lordis / and barons / of the toun, 
And of the wisest / of his Regioun, 
How he myghte maken resistence, 
Manfully / to stonden / at diffence, 
To be so strong / that ther wer no doute. 
How Ethiocles made hym strong ageyn þe comyng of þe Grekes.

And in the contrees / adiacent aboute, 
And ek also in foreyn Regiouns, 
He hath withhold / all the Champiouns; 
And ther-vpon / he sent out his espies 
And his frendës and his next allies 
And alle the worthy / dwellyng enviroun, 
Ȝong / fressh / and lusty / he gadred into toun; 
Maskowede his wallys / and his heghë tours, 
And stuffëd hem / with manly sowdëours. 
Round aboute / he settë many Gonnys, 
Grete and smale / and somë large as tonnys; 
And, in his hasty / passing feruent hete, 
He spent his tresour / and gaf giftës grete 
Vnto knyghtes / and worthy men of name; 
And ouermorë / to encres his fame, 
he ȝaf to lordes / Iuellis many-fold, 
Clothës of Veluet / of Damask, and of gold, 
To gete hym hertës / sothly, as I rede, 
To helpe hym now in his grete nede. 
And prudently purveiëd / hym to-forn 
Of flessh and fissh / and of wyn and corn. 
115
Sette his Capteyns / erly / and ek late 
with ful gret stuf strong at euery gate. 
And mad also be werkmen / that were trewe, 
Barbykans / and bulwerkës newe, 
Barreris / cheynys / and dichës wonder depe; 
Makyng his Vouh the Citè forto kepe 
Whil he lyueþ / despit of all his foon. 
And by his goddys of metal and of ston, 
Ful ofte he swoor / both of herte and thouht, 
That it shal first / ful derë be abouht, 
And many a man with pollex, swerd, and knyff 
To-for this toune / shal first lese his liff, 
And ther shal ek / many sydës blede, 
Or his brother pessibly possede 
The toune in pees / lich as Grekës wene. 
But at the ende / the trouthë shal be sene, 
lat hym be war and wel to-forn provyde!
For Adrastus / on that other side, 
For his party was not necligent, 
But on a day / helde a parlement, 
All his lordës sittyng enviroun, 
To dryvë shortly / a pleyn conclusioun 
And vp tapoynt / the fyn of ther entent.
But somë thoughte / ful expedient, 
Or they procede / to wirkë be thavice 
116
Of on that was ful prudent and right wyce 
And circumspecte / in his werkës alle, 
A worthy bisshop / into agë falle, 
And Callëd was, sothly / by his name 
Amphiorax / of whom the grete fame 
How the bysshope Amphiorax was sent for to come to þe Grekes.

Thorgh al the londe / bothen est and south, 
Amongës Grekës / passingly was kouth; 
A man, in soth / of olde antiquytè 
And most acceptid of auctoritè, 
First be resoun of his high estat 
And ek for he was so fortunat 
In his werkes, and was also secrè 
with the goddys, knowyng her pryvetè: 
By graunt of whom / as bookës specifye, 
He hadde a spirit / of trewë prophecye, 
And cowde aforn ful opynly dyvyne 
Thynggës begonnë / how they shuldë fyne, 
And eke, be craft / of Calculacioun, 
Ȝiue a dome / of euery questioun; 
And hadde in magik / grete experience, 
And fyndë cowde / be heuenly influence 
And by mevyng / of þe heghë sterrys, 
A fynal doome of Contek and of Werrys; 
And wistë wel, as his goddys tolde, 
that, ȝif Grekës / forth her iournè holde, 
It turnë shuldë platly /, this no fage, 
117
To gret meschief / and to gret damage 
Of hem ychon /; and in especial 
The moste parte / of the blood Royal 
The proph[e]cie of Amphiorax.


Thorgh al Grece, it may not be withdrawe, 
In this viagë shortly shal be slawe; 
And ȝif hym-silf / with the Grekës wente, 
Who that euer wepte hym / or bymente, 
This was the fyn / and may nat be socoured, 
Of the erth / he shuldë be deuoured, 
Quyk as he was, he knewe it in certeyn.
And for he saugh ther was non oþer geyn 
To saue his lif / nor no bet diffence, 
Than vttrely withdrawën his presence;
Preying his wiff / for hym to provide, 
Ȝif he wer sought / that she wold hym hide, 
And wommanly / for to kepe hym cloos, 
And of trouth concelen his purpoos; 
For al his trust / touchyng his greuaunce, 
was fully sette / in hir purvyance. 
I hope to god / that he thar not drede 
Of no deceyt / in hir wommanhede. 
She was so trewe / as wommen ben echon, 
And also cloos / and mwët as a ston, 
That she ne wold / as the matier stood, 
Discurën hym / for no worldly good.
118
But fynaly / the Grekës, of entent, 
In al his drede / han for this bisshop sent; 
Thogh it was long / er they myght hym fynde, 
For cause his wif / was to hym so kynde, 
That ful seurly / hath lokkëd vp his cors. 
But for she hadde a maner of remors 
In hir-silf / grevyng her conscience, 
How the wif of Amphiorax of conscience to saue her hoth discured her husbond.

Dreding to falle / in ful grete offence, 
Lest her soulë / were in peryl lorn, 
whan she be oth / compellëd was and sworn; 
They requeryng / ȝif she coudë telle 
wher her lord the bisshop shuldë dwelle: 
Which to discure / hir herte was ful loth, 
Til tyme she gan / remembren on her oth, 
And coude a trouth / of Custom not denye 
And hadde also gret conscience to lye, 
Wonder hevy / with a sorowful face, 
Maugrè hir lust / taught hem to the place 
wher as he was / shet vp in a toure, 
Al alonë / havyng no socour. 
They falle on hym / or that he was war, 
And sette hym vp / in a ful richë Char.
A fool he was / to Iupard his lif 
Forto discure his counsel to his wif; 
And ȝit she was ful sory for his sake, 
Specially / whan she saugh hym take. 
Bot I hopë / that her hevynesse 
119
Gan asswage ful sonë, by processe, 
In short tymë / whan that he was gon. 
Ther is no tempest / may last euere in on.
But this bisshope / be verrey force and myght, 
Vnto Grekes / conveyëd was ful right, 
This hoorë gray / in his char syttyng. 
And they ful gladë / wern of his comyng, 
havyng a trust / and ful opynyoun 
That, thorgh cause and occasioun 
Of his wisdam / and his sapience 
And by vertue / of his hegh presence, 
They shuld eschewe / al aduersitè 
Possible to falle / as in her Iournè.
And, as the story / fully hath devised, 
Ful circumspect / and riht wel avised, 
he hath pronouncëd / in the Parlement, 
To-forn the lordës / and the president, 
his Cleer conceyte / in verray sikernesse, 
Nat entrykëd with no doublenesse, 
her dysemol daiës / and her fatal houres, 
Her auenturys / and her sharpë shoures, 
The froward soort / and the vnhappy stoundys, 
The compleyntës / of her dedly woundys, 
The wooful wrath / and the contrarioustè 
Of fellë Mars / in his crueltè, 
And howe, by mene / of his gery mood, 
120
Ther shal be shadde / al the worthy blood 
Of the Grekes / it may not ben eschewed, 
If her purpoos be execute / and swed. 
“Ther is no morë / this shal be the fyn: 
The hegh noblesse shal drawë to declyne 
Of Grekës blood / in meschief, sorowe, and woo: 
And with al this / I my-silf also, 
As my fatë hath a-forn disposyd, 
Depe in the grounde / I shal be enclosed, 
And lokkëd vp / in the dirkë vale 
Of cruel deth.” / lo! this was the tale 
That the bisshope / to Adrastus tolde, 
Hym counsayllyng / his purpos to withholde, 
In eschuyng of mor meschief and sorowe. 
For alle his goddis he took vnto borowe, 
Ȝif þe Thebans / and þe grekës mete, 
The fyn þerof shal be so vnswete 
Þat alle grece after shal it rewe; 
warnyng hem / ȝif þei the meschief knewe 
That shal folowe/ which no man may lette, 
Thei wold abstene / a siegë forto sette 
Vnto Thebës / and her purpoos leve.
with whos wordes / the lordës gan hem greve, 
And ther-Inne haddë / but ful smal delit, 
And euerechon / of hertly hegh despit, 
They abrayde / and seide he was vntrewe, 
A controover / of propheciës newe, 
And ek also / for al his longe berde, 
121
An olde Dotard / a coward, and aferde; 
And of Rancour / gonnë to diffye 
Both his kalkyng / and his astronomye, 
And shortly seide / þei took therof non hede, 
Ne wil no-thyng / gouerne hem after his rede. 
This was the clamour / and noyse, in euery cost, 
Of hegh and lough / þorgh-out all the hoost, 
And specialy / of the sowdëours, 
And of lordës / regnyng in her flours, 
And of thestates / effectuely, I mene, 
which of agë / were but tendre and grene, 
That han not hadde / by martys Influence, 
Of the werrë / gret experience.
her, ȝif ȝe list / ȝe may considre and Se 
Of conceytes ful grete diuersytè, 
How that ȝouth / no peril cast a-forn 
Til he by meschief / sodeynly be lorn, 
Wher as age / provydeth / euery thing 
Or he bygynne / to casten the endyng.
ȝouth is gouernyd / be a largë Reyne 
How age and ȝouth ben of diuerse opynyons


To rennë forth, / and can hym not reffreyn, 
But of hede / set on al attonys, 
As he that hurtleth / ageynës hardë stonys 
122
Broseth hym-silf / vnwarly and parbraketh. 
But age experte / no thyng vndertaketh 
But he to-forn / be good discrecioun, 
Make a due examynacioun 
How it wil tourne / outher to badde or good.
But ȝouth, as fast / as sterëd is the blood, 
Taketh emprises of hasty wilfulnesse, 
Ioye at the gynnyng / the ende is wrechednesse.
The oldë, prudent / in al his gouernaunce, 
Ful longe a-forn / maketh purueaunce; 
But ȝouth allas be counsail wil not wyrke, 
For which ful ofte / he stumbleth in the dyrke. 
Thus selde is seyne / the trouthë to termyne, 
That age and ȝouthë / drawë be o lyne.
And wher that foly hath domynacioun, 
Wisdam is putte / into subieccioun, 
lik as this bysshop /, with al his hegh prudence, 
For cause he myghte haue / no audience, 
How that wisdam wiþ-oute supportacioun avayleþ lit or noȝt.

All his wisdam / and his profecye 
Of the Grekes / was holden but folye. 
For thogh Plato / and wisë Socrates, 
Moral Senek / and Diogenes, 
Albumasar / and prudent Tholomee, 
And Tullius / that haddë souereyntè 
123
whylom in Rome / as of elloquence: 
Thogh all thise /, shortly in sentence, 
were a-lyve / most konnyng and experte, 
And no man list / her counsel to aduerte, 
Nor of her sawës / forto taken hede, 
What myght availle / and it cam to nede? 
For wher prudence / can fyndë no socour 
And prouidencë / haueth no favour, 
Farwel wisdam / farwel discrecioun, 
For lakke only / of supportacioun. 
For vnsupported / with his lokkës hore, 
Amphiorax / sighën / gan ful sore 
With hede enclynyd / and many evyl thouht, 
whan that he sauhe his counsayl stood for nought. 
For vttrely / the grekës, as I tolde, 
han fully cast / her Iournè for to holde, 
Made hem redy / and gonnen to hosteye 
Toward Thebës / the Cytè to werreye; 
And in Grecë / wil no lenger tarye, 
And forth with hem / Amphiorax they carye, 
Sette in his Char / with a doolful herte, 
Whan he wist / he myghte not asterte 
Of his fate / the disposicioun. 
And hosteying / into the Regioun 
Of lygurgus / Grekës gan approche 
A sondy londe / with many Craggy roche. 
124
But al the way, sothly, þat þei gon, 
For hors nor man / water was þer non: 
So dryë weren the valës and the pleynys. 
For al þat ȝeere / they hadden had no reynys 
But ful gret drouht / as mad is mencioun; 
And al the londe / Cerchyng enviroun 
þe grete meschief þat Grekes hadde for watere.

They nowther fondë / wellë nor Ryver

That they allas / no refut ne konne. 
So inportable / was the shenë sonne, 
So hoot on hem / in feldës wher they leye, 
That for meschief / man and hors gan deye, 
Gapyng ful drye / vpward into south; 
And somë putten / her swerdës in her mouth 
And sperys hedes /, in story as is told, 
Taswage her thirst / with the yren cold; 
And of his lif / ful many on dispeyred 
In this meschief / and hom ageyn repeyred: 
Tyl on a day / worthy Tydeus, 
And with hym ek the kyng Campaneus, 
Of purpoos rood / þorgh-oute the contrè 
ȝif they myght eny water See, 
Fro Coost to cost / bothë fer and ner; 
Til of fortune / they entred an herber, 
with treës Shadowed for the sonnë Shene, 
Ful of flourës / and of herbës grene, 
125
Wonder hoolsom / both of syyt and ayr; 
Ther-Inne a lady / which passingly was fayr, 
Sittyng as tho / vnder a laurer tre; 
And in her Armes / a litil child hadd she, 
Ful gracious / of loke and of visage, 
And was also / wondre tendre of age, 
Sone of the kyng / born forto succede, 
Callëd ligurgus / in story as I rede, 
Whoos hertly Ioye / and worldly ek disport, 
Al his myrthë / plesaunce, and confort 
Was in this child / of excellent fayrnesse.
And this lady / Myrour of semlynesse, 
Al sodeynly as she cast vp her sight 
And on his stedë / sauh an armëd knyght, 
Gretely abasshëd / gan anon remwe. 
how Tideus compleyned to þe lady in the herber for water.


But Tideus after gan to swe 
And seydë / “sustir / beth no-thyng dismayed, 
In ȝoure-silf displesëd nor affrayed! 
For we ar come / only to þis place

126
And many other / with pollex / speer and sheld,

For ther was non / of hegh nor lowgh degrè

And whan this lady / Inly vertuous,

Of verrey pytè / chaungeth cher and hewe, 
And in her herte / vpon her woo gan rewe, 
And ful goodly / seyng his distresse,

But who was glad / and who was tho Iocounde 
But Tydeus / Seyng the Ryver! 
which in al hast / sente his messager 
To Adrastus / and bad hym nat abide, 
But doune descendë / to the Ryver-syde 
with al his host / recur forto haue 
At this Ryver / her lyuës forto saue. 
And þei enhast hem / makyng non abood, 
All attonys / to the Ryver rood 
Forto drynkë /; þei hadde so gret lust 
Of appetit / forto staunche her thrust. 
And somë dronk / and fonde it did hem good; 
And somë wern / so feruent and so wood 
Vppon the water / that in sikernesse, 
Thorgh vndiscret / and hasty gredynesse, 
Out of mesur / the watere so þei drynke 
That they fille ded / euene vpon the brynke; 
And somë naked / into þe Ryvere ronne, 
Only for hete / of the somer sonne, 
To bathen hem /, the water was so cold; 
And some also / as I haue ȝow told, 
I menë tho that prudent wern and wise, 
The water drank / in mesurable wyse, 
That of þe thrust / they haue to-forn endured 
They were refresshëd / fully and recured.
And Grekës than / of hegh and lowe degrè, 
129
For high profit / and gret commoditè, 
Compas the Ryuere / cristalyn of sighte, 
Of oon accorde / they her tentys pyhte 
To rest hem ther / in relees of her peyne, 
Only the space / of a day or tweyne.
And whylys Grekes / vpon the Ryuer lay, 
This Tydeus / vpon the same day 
Ful knyghtly / hath don his diligence, 
This ȝonge lady / with gret reverence, 
To Adrastus / goodly to presente: 
At whoos comyng / þe kyng hym-silvë wente 
Ageynës hir / she fallyng doun on knees, 
All thestatës present and degrees 
Of Grekës lond /, absent was nat on; 
And in his Armës / took hir vp anon, 
Thanking hir / of her bysynesse, 
Of hir labour / and her kyndënesse, 
Behotyng hir / lik as he was holde, 
If eny thyng pleynly that she wolde 
That he may don / she shuld it redy fynde. 
And Grekës all /, the story maketh mynde, 
Of thestatys / beyng tho present, 
Thankëd hir / with al her hool entent, 
For refresshyng / don to many Grek; 
And for her part / they biheght her ek, 
With her body / and goodës bothë two, 
What her list / comaunde hem forto do, 
130
To be redy platly / and nat faille.
And her myn autour / makeþ rehersaille 
That þis lady / so faire vpon to se, 
Of whom þe namë was Isyphilè, 
To Adrastus told /, as ȝe may rede, 
Lynealy / the stok / of her kynrede, 
Whilom how she / a kyngges doghter was: 
Rehersyng hym / hooly al the cas, 
First why þat she / out of her contrè wente, 
Shortly for she woldë not assente 
To execute / a conspiracioun, 
Mad by the wymmen / of that Regioun, 
A thyng contrayr / and ageyn al right, 
That eche of hem / vpon a certeyn nyght, 
Be on accord / shal warly taken kepe, 
Fader / brother / and husbond in her slepe, 
With knyvës sharpe / and rasourës kene 
Kytt her throtës / in that mortal tene; 
Vnto this fyn /, as bochas tellë can, 
In al that londe / be not founde a man, 
But slayn echon / to þis conclusioun 
That wymmen / myght han domynacioun 
In þat kyngdam / to regne at libertè 
And on no partie / Interrupted be.
But for þis lady / passing debonayre, 
To þis mordre / was froward and contrayre, 
Kept her fader / þat he was not slawe 
But fro þe deth / preseruëd and wiþdrawe, 
131
For which, allas! / she fleddë þe contrè, 
And of a pyrat / taken in the see, 
To kyng lygurgus / brouht In al her drede. 
And for her trouþ / and her wommanhede 
To hir he took / his ȝonge child to kepe, 
which in the herber / allonë she left slepe 
whan Tydeus / she broghte to the welle.
And by Iason / somë bookis telle

That this lady / haddë sonës two, 
whan that he / and hercules also 
Toward Colchos / by hir contrè Cam 
For tacomplyssh / þe conquest of the Ram.

But who that lyst / by and by to se 
The story hool / of this ysyphylè, 
Hir fadres name / of which also I wante, 
Thouh somë seyn / he namëd was Thoante, 
And somë bokës . vermes ek hym calle: 
But to knowe / þe auenturës alle 
Of þis lady . Isyphilè the faire, 
So feithful ay / and inly debonayre, 
Lok on the book / that Iohn Bochas made 
Whilom of wommen / with rethorikës glade, 
And directe / be ful souereyn style 
To fayrë Ianë / the queen of Cecile. 
Rede ther the rubrich / of ysiphylè, 
132
Of her trouth / and her hegh bountè, 
Ful craftily conpilëd for her sake.
And whan that she haþ her lieuë take 
Of Adrastus /, homward in her weye 
Tydeus gan hyr to conveye, 
To the gardyne / til she is repeyred. 
But now, allas! my mater disespeyred 
Of alle Ioye / and of alle welfulnesse, 
And destitut / of myrth and alle gladnesse, 
For now of woo / gynnë þe sharpë shoures. 
For this lady / fond among the floures 
How þe child was slayn wiþ the Serpent.

her litil child / turnëd vp þe face, 
Slayn of a serpent / in þe seluë place, 
hyr tailë burlyd / with skalis siluer-shene. 
The Venym / was / so persyng and so kene, 
So perilous ek / the mortal violence 
Causëd, allas! / thorgh her long absence: 
She was to slouh / homward forto hie. 
But now can she / but wepe, wayle, and crye; 
Now can she nouht / but sighen and compleyn 
And wofully wryng her handys tweyn, 
Dedly of look / pal of face and chere; 
And gan to rende / her giltë tresses clere, 
133
And oftë sith she gan to seyn, “allas! 
O wooful wrech / vnhappy in this cas, 
What shal I don / or whider may I tourne? 
For þis the fyn / ȝif I her soiourne, 
I woot right wel / I may it not eskape 
The pitous fatë / þat is for me shape. 
Socour is non / nor ther may be non red, 
lich my desert / but that I mot be ded; 
For thorhe my slouth / and my neclygence 
I haue, allas! don so gret offence 
That my gilt /, I may it nat excuse, 
Shal to the kyng / of treson me accuse. 
Thorgh my defaute / and slouthë bothë two, 
His sone is ded / and his heir also, 
which he louëd mor than al his good: 
For tresour non / so nygh his hertë stood, 
Nor was so depë / graue / in his corage: 
That he is likly to fallen in a Rage 
whan it is so, myn odyous offence 
Reported be vnto his audience; 
So inportable shal be his hevynesse.
And wel woot I / in verrey sothfastnesse, 
That, whan the quenë / hath this þing espied, 
To myn excus / It may nat be denyed, 
134
I doutë it not / ther geyneth no pytè, 
With-out respit / she wil avengëd be 
On me, allas! / as I ha deserued; 
That fro the deth / I may not be preserued 
Nowther be bille / ne supplicacioun; 
For the rage / of my transgressioun 
Requereth deth / and non other mede.”
And thus, allas! she, quaking in her drede, 
Non other helpe / nor remedyë kan, 
But dreynt in sorow / to þe Grekës Ran, 
Of hertly woo / face and chere disteyned 
And her chekes with wepyng al bereynyd, 
In hir affray / distracte and furious. 
To-forn alle / she cam to Tydeus, 
And fille on knees / and gan her compleynt mak, 
Toldë pleynly / that for grekës sake 
She mot be ded / and shortly in substaunce 
Rehersing hym the grete of her greuaunce: 
First how be traynys of a fals serpent 
The child was slawë / whil she was absent; 
In what disioynte / and peril that she stood.
And whan that he her meschief vnderstood, 
Vnto hire ful knyghtly he behiht 
To help and forther / al that euere he myght, 
hir pitous woo / to stynten and appese. 
And forto fynde / vnto hir dissesse 
Hasty confort, he went a ful gret pas 
135
To Adrastus / and told hym al the cas 
Of þis vnhappy / wooful aventure, 
Beseching hym to don his bysy cure, 
As he was bound / of equytè and riȝt, 
And aduerten / and to han a siȝt 
How she qwit her to Grekës her to-forn 
whan they wer likly / forto haue be lorn, 
The socour voide of her wommanhede: 
For which he most of knyghthod taken hede 
To remedien þis vnhappy thing.
And Adrastus / lik a worthy kyng 
Taquyt hym-silf /, the story makeþ mynd, 
To thys lady wille nat be found vnkynd, 
Neither for cost / nor for no travaylle, 
But bysy was / in al þat myght availle 
To hir socour / considered alle þingges, 
And by thavice / of alle þe worthy kyngges 
Of Grekës lond / þei be accorded thus, 
Prynces, Dukës / and worthy Tydeus, 
To hold her way / and al at onys ryde 
To lygurgus / dwelling ther be-syde, 
Of on entent / ȝif they may purchace 
In eny wisë / forto getë grace 
For this lady, Callëd ysiphilè; 
They wold assayë ȝif it myghte be.
And to his paleys ful ryal bylt of ston, 
136
The worthy Grekes / cam ryding euerichon, 
Euery lord ful fresshly on his stede. 
And lygurgus / example of manlihede, 
Anon as he knewe of her comyng, 
Taquyt hym-silf / lich a gentil kyng, 
Ageyn hem went / to mete hem on the way, 
How Adrastus and all thestatis of Grekis praiden lygurgus for þe lif of ysyphile.

Ful wel byseyn / and in ful good array, 
Receyvyng hem with a ful kyngly chere. 
And to Adrastus seid, as ȝe shul here,
“Cosyn,” quod he / and gan hym to enbrace, 
“Ȝe be welcome / to ȝoure ownë place, 
Thankyng hertly to ȝour hegh noblesse 
That so goodly / of ȝour gentillesse 
Towardës me / ȝe list ȝou to acquite, 
Ȝoure-silf þis day / ȝour cosyn to visite, 
In this castel to takë ȝoure loggyng; 
That neuer ȝit / I was so glad of thyng 
In al my lif / and therto her my trouth. 
And ouermorë / ther shal be no slouth 
That the Chambres / and the largë tours 
Shal be delyuered / to ȝour herberiours; 
That euery lord / as he is of degrè, 
Vnto his loggyng / shal assignëd be. 
Ȝoure officerës / lat hem-silf devise 
137
Ȝif the howsyng / may largëly suffise 
To ȝow and ȝourës / strecchen and atteyn, 
That non estaat / haue causë to compleyn. 
And alle ȝour hoost / loggëd her be-syde, 
which in Tentys / vpon ȝou abide, 
lat hem fette / be myn auctoritè, 
Vitayle ynoh / her in my Citè. 
And alle that may socour hem or saue, 
And, at a word /, al that euere I haue 
Is ful and hool / at ȝour comaundëment.”
Quod Adrastus / “that is nat our entent, 
Nor on no parte / cause of oure comyng. 
For we be come al for anoþer thyng, 
A certeyn gift / of ȝou to requere, 
Benygnëly / ȝif ȝe list to here, 
which may Grekës / passyngly availle, 
Of our request / ȝif that ȝe nat ne faille, 
which we dar not / opynly expresse, 
with-outë that ȝe wold / of gentillesse, 
Ȝoure graunt aforn / conferme and ratefye. 
Than wer we bold / it to specifye.”
138
Quod lygurgus / “what-euer thyng it be, 
Nouht exceptid / but only þinggës thre:
The first is this / it touchë nat my lif, 
My ȝonge sonë, pleynly, nor my wyf; 
Take al my good / or what ȝe list provyde 
Of my tresour / and sette þies thre a-syde, 
Al the surplus / I count nat at a myte.”
Than Adrastus / astounyd was a lyte 
whan lygurgus / in conclusioun, 
Of his sonë / made excepcioun. 
And whilis they / entreten þus yfere, 
Ther cam forth on / with a wooful chere, 
Of face and look / pal and no-thing rede, 
A-lowdë crieth / “the kyngës sone is dede, 
Allas the whyl! / that whilom was so fayr, 
After lygurgus / born forto ben hayr; 
The which, allas! / hath ȝolden vp the breth, 
Of a Serpent / stonge to the deth 
And with his woundë / newë, fressh and grene, 
In therber lith / that pitè is to sene, 
And hath so leyne / almost al this day;” 
139
That whan lygurgus / herdë this affray, 
And wist his child was ded and hath no mo, 
Lytil wonder / thogh that he were wo. 
For sodeynly / the inportable smerte 
Ran anon / and hent hym by the herte 
That, for constreynt / of his dedly peyne, 
Throgh-oute he felte koruen euery veyne. 
The sorow þat þe kyng ligurgus made for the deth of his child and the lamentacioun of the quene.


The ragë gan myne in hym so depe 
That he can not but sighë / sobbe, and wepe.
And with the noyse / and lamentacioun 
The qwen distrauht / is descendid doun. 
And whan she knewe / the ground of al this sorowe, 
hit neded her no teerës / forto borowe 
But twenty tymë ny vpon a rowe 
A-swoune she fille / vnto þe grounde lowe; 
And stoundë-melë / for this hegh meschaunce, 
Stille as ston / she lyggeth in a Traunce.
And whan the child / into the courte was brouht 
To-fore lygurgus / allas! I wite hym nought, 
Vpon the cors / with a mortal face, 
he Fil atonys / and gan it to embrace, 
140
Soorë Grype / and ageyn vpsterte;
That whan Adrastus / gan this thyng aduerte, 
Of kyngly routh / and compassioun 
From his eyen / the teerës fillë doun 
Ek kyngges / Dukës, that aboutë stood, 
Only of pitè / which is in gentyl blood, 
No power hadde / the water to restreyn 
That on her chekës / doune bygan to reyn.
But al a day / woldë not suffise 
Alle her sorowes / in ordre to devise, 
First of the kyng / and of the quene also: 
To tellen all / I shuldë neuer ha do, 
Not in the space / almost of an hour. 
But whan the stormës / and þe sharpë shour 
Of her wepyng / was somwhat ouergon, 
The lytil cors / was grauen vnder ston.
And Adrastus / in þe samë tide 
lygurgus took / a litil out aside, 
And ful wisely / with his prudent spech, 
The qwenë present / gan hym forto tech 
That so to sorowe / avayllë may right noght, 
To mordre hym-silf / with his ownë thouht, 
141
Sith loos of deth / no man may recure 
Thogh he in woo / perpetuelly endure; 
Al helpeth nat / whan the soule is go.
Ageynes deth may be no recur. that our life is but a pilgrimage;


“And our lif her, who taketh hed ther-to, 
Is but an exile / and a pilgrymage, 
Ful of torment / and of bitter Rage, 
Lich a See . rennyng to and fro, 
Swyng an ebbë / whan the flood is do, 
Lytil space abidyng at the fulle: 
Of whos soiour / the popë ȝeueþ no bulle. 
For kyng is non, nor duk, nor Emperour, 
That may hym shroude / ageyn þe fatal shour 
Of cruel deth / whan hym list manace 
To marke a man with his mortal mace. 
Than geyneþ nat to his sauacioun 
Neyther Fraunchysë / nor proteccioun, 
And lit / or noght / may helpen in this caas 
Sauffecondit / or Supersedyas. 
For in this world / who so look a-right, 
Is non so gret / of power nor of myght, 
Noon so richë / shortly / nor so bold 
But he mot dey / outher ȝong or old. 
And who in ȝouthë / passeth þis passage, 
he is eskapëd / al the woodë Rage, 
Al sorowe and trouble / of this present lyff, 
142
Repleneshëd with contek / werre and stryff, 
which seeld or neuere / stont in Suertè. 
Wher-for best is, as semeth vnto me, 
No man gruchë / but, of hegh prudence, 
The sonde of goddis / tak in pacience. 
And ȝe that ben so wis / and manly to, 
ȝoure-silf to drowne in torment and in woo 
For loos of thyng / ȝif that ȝe list to se, 
which in no wisë may recurëd be, 
Is gret foly and vndiscreccioun.”
And thus Adrastus / hath conveyëd doun 
The substaunce hool / of that he wolde seye: 
Til that he fond / a tymë forto preye 
Conuenyent / for ysyphilee, 
Bysechyng hym forto han pitè 
Of þat she hath offended his highnesse, 
Not wilfully / but of reklesnesse: 
First þat he wold / his doomës so dyvide, 
Mercy preferre / and settë right a-side, 
At the request and preier of hem alle, 
Of this vnhappe / and meschief that is falle 
143
By hasty Rigour / nat to do vengeaunce, 
But thynk aforn / in his purvyaunce, 
who to wrechës / doth mercy / in her drede, 
Shal mercy fyndë / whan he hath most nede: 
And sith he hath power, myght, and space, 
Lat hym tak this lady / to his grace, 
For lak of routhë / that she nat ne dye.
But tho the quenë / gan agayn replye 
How the quen wil algate han þe serpent dede.


And platly seide / as in this matere, 
Avayleth not requeste / nor preyere, 
Pytè, Mercy / nor remyssyoun, 
But ȝif it be / by this condicioun 
That the serpent, cause of al þis sorowe, 
Thorgh her labour / lay his hed to borowe. 
This is fynal / and vtter recompense 
To fyndë gracë / for her gret offence, 
Or ellis Shortly / sheedë blood for blood.
And whan Grekys her answer vnderstood, 
Al of accord / in her beste wise, 
Took on hem / this auenturous emprise, 
For loue only / of Ysyphylee; 
And gan to ryde / envyron þe contrè, 
By hillës, valës / Rochës, and ek Cauës, 
144
In dychis dirk / and in oldë gravis, 
By euery cooste / cerchyng vp and doun: 
Til at the last / ful famous of renoun, 
How parthonolope saugh þe Serpent.

The worthy knyght / parthonolopè 
was the first / that happëd for to Se 
This hydous Serpent / by a Ryver-side, 
Gret and horrible / stern and ful of pride, 
Vndere a Rocchë / by a banke lowe; 
And in al hast / he bent a sturdy bowe, 
And ther-In sette an arowe fylëd kene, 
And thorgh the body / spotted blew and grene, 
Ful myghtily he made it forto Glyde, 
Hent out a swerde / hongyng be his syde, 
Smoot of his hede / and anon it hent 
And ther-with-al gan the Quene present, 
wherthorgh her sorowe parcel gan aswage.
And thus, of prowesse / and of hegh corage, 
This manly man / parthonolopè 
hath reconcilëd faire Isyphilee 
Vnto gracë / fully of þe Quene, 
Hir Ire avoided / and her oldë tene. 
And by Adrastus mediacioun, 
Kyng lygurgus / graunted a pardoun 
To this lady, that from al daunger fre, 
She was restorëd to her libertè, 
145
In his paleys / al her lif to dwelle. 
Thogh Iohn Bochas / þe contrarie telle: 
For this autour affermeþ /, out of dred 
That, whan this child / was by the serpent ded, 
She durste not / for her gret offence 
Neuer after comen in presence 
Of lygurgus /, but of intencioun 
Fledde anon / out of that Regioun; 
Att herte she took / the childës deth so sore. 
what fille of hir / I fyndë can no more 
Than ȝe han herd / aforn me specifye.
And the kyngdam / but ȝif bookys lye, 
Of lygurgus / was ycallëd Trace.

And this Bachus / for the grete wrong 
Brak his lymys / and dreynt hym in þe See. 
Of lygurgus / ȝe gete no more of me.

Now vnto Grekys / I wil retourne ageyn, 
To tellë forth shortly, ȝif I konne, 
Of her Iournè / that they haue begonne: 
how Adrastus / hath his lievë take 
Of ligurgus / with his browës blake; 
And departyng, with seynt Iohn to borowe, 
Mad his wardës / on the nexte morowe 
So wel beseyn / so myghty, and so strong, 
Wonder erly / whan þe larkë song, 
With a trompet / warnëd euery man 
To be redy / in al the hast they kan, 
Forto remwe / and no letting make. 
147
And so they han / the righte way I-take 
Touard Thebës / the grekës euerychon, 
That such a nombre / gadred into on, 
Of worthy knyghtës neuere aforn was seyn, 
whan they in ferë / monstred in a pleyn. 
And they ne stynt by non occasioun 
Til they be come euen a-for the toun, 
And pight her tentys / proudly, as I rede, 
Vnder the wallys / in a grenë mede.
And whan the thebans / were besette aboute, 
The manly knyghtës / wold han yssyd oute 
And haue scarmosshëd / in her lusty pride, 
With her foomen / on the toþer side. 
But be byddyng / of Ethiocles 
Alle þilkë nyght / þei kepte hem-silf in pes, 
Be cause only / that it was so late, 
With gret awayt / set at euery gate,

Lest þer werë / treynys or tresoun. 
And on the tours / and in the Chief Dongoun

And Grekys proudly / al þe longe nyght

Sette vp loggyng / vpon euery Syde

Compas the toune / ther was no voidë space 
But al besette / her foomen to manace.
And whilys they afor þe Citè laye, 
On euery cost / they sent out to forraye,

And to his brother / in party fauorable; 
The variaunce in Thebes among hem-silf.


For in the Citè / ther was variance, 
which vnto hym was a gret meschaunce; 
For in his nedë / shortly / he ne wiste 
Vpon whoom / þat he myghte triste; 
For they wer not / alle of on entent: 
For which he hath / for his counsale sent, 
150
Al his lordës / and the oldë Quene, 
which as he demptë / werë pur and clene, 
Hool of on herte / and not variable, 
Of old expert / and alway founde stable; 
Requeryng hem / be-causë they were wys, 
Al openly to tellen . / ther avis 
Wher it was bet / pleynly, in her sight, 
With his brother / to treten or to fight.
And somë gaf / a ful blunt sentence, 
which hadde / of werrë / non experience: 
Seyde it was best /, and nat ben afferd, 
To trye his right / manly with þe Swerd. 
And some also / that wer moor prudent, 
Spak vnto hym / by good avisëment 
And list nat sparë / but their conceyte tolde 
how hit was best / his couenaunt forto holde, 
And to parforn / his heeste mad to-forn 
To his brother / lich as he was sworn; 
So that his word /, the wors to mak hym spede, 
Be nat foundë / variant fro the dede, 
Nota

For non hatred / rancour, neyther pryde. 
The word of þe qwene Iocasta to Ethiocles.

And tho / the queenë / took hym out aside, 
Tolde hym pleynly / it was ful vnsittyng 
Swich doublenesse / to fynden in a kyng, 
151
And seide hym ek / al-thoh he were strong, 
To his brother / how he didë wrong, 
“As al the toune / wil record, in dede, 
And berë witnesse / ȝif it kam to nede. 
Wherfor lat vs shape another mene 
In this materë / whil that it is grene, 
Or this quarel /, gonne of voluntè, 
Turne / in the fyn / to mor aduersitè. 
For ȝif it be / darreynëd be bataylle, 
who tresteth most / may ful likly faille. 
And it is foly / be short avisëment, 
To putte a strif / in martys Iugëment. 
For hard it is / whan a Iuge is wood, 
To tret aforn hym / with-out loos of blood. 
How perilous it is to be governyd by (short auisement in) any querel.


And ȝif we put our mater / hool in Marte, 
which with the swerd / his lawës doth coarte, 
Than may hit happe / wher ȝe be glad or loth, 
Thow and thy brother / shal repente both; 
And many a-noþer / that is her present, 
Of ȝoure trespas / that ben Innocent,

For the debat / only of ȝow tweyn, 
And for ȝour strif / shal fyndë ful vnsoote.
“And for thow art gynnyng, ground, and Roote

Of this Iniurie / and this gret vnright, 
To the goddys / that herof han a sight, 
Thow shalt accountys / and a reknyng make 
For alle tho / that persshyn for þi sake. 
And now the causë / dryven is so ferre, 
Sodeyn pees / outher hasty werre 
Moot folwe anon /; for the fatal chaunce 
Of lif and deth / dependeth in balaunce. 
And no man may / be no craft restreyne 
That vpon on / platly of this tweyne

Who so euer lawgh / or ellys mourne. 
And thow art dryve / so narowë to þe stake

By non engyn / thow canst / it not declyne. 
And hasty cas /, as folk seyn that be wys,

For trete longe / now avaylleth noght. 
For to the poynt / sothly thou art brouht,

And that shal turnë / most to thyn avail.

And shortly tho / for verrey Irë wroth, 
Thouh he therto / froward was and loth, 
Accorded is /, heryng al the prees, 
ȝif he algate shal trete for a pes, 
It moste be / by this condicioun 
That he wol han / the domynacioun

As hym thouht / he haddë wel disserued, 
And saue to hym / hool the souereyntè; 
And vnder hym / in Thebës þe Citè

Than tavoyde / and not resoort ageyn: 
For mor to cleymë / was nat but In veyn. 
This wold he don / only for her sake, 
And other-wise / he wil non endë make

And fynally / among his lordys alle 
Ther was not on / of hih nor lowgh estat, 
154
That woldë gon / on this ambassyat 
Out of the toune / nouther for bet nor wors; 
Til Iocasta / madë sadyl her hors, 
And cast her-silf / to gon for this tretè, 
To make an endë / ȝif it woldë be.
And this was don / the morowe right be tyme, 
Vpon the hourë / whan it droh to pryme. 
And with hyr went / hyr ȝonge dohtres tweyne, 
Antygonè / and the feyr ymeyne, 
Of hyr meynè / ful many on aboute, 
At the gate / she was conveyëd oute, 
And of purpos / she madë first hir went 
On hors-bak / to kyng Adrastus tent,

And they receyve hyr / with a right glad chere,

And ek ymeyne / excellyng of bewtè. 
And for that they / passyngly were faire, 
Gret was the pres / concours, and repaire 
Of the ladyes forto han a sight.
And Iocasta / procedeth anon ryght 
155
To Adrastus / hir mater to purpose, 
And gan to hym / opynly disclose 
Thentent and will of Ethiocles, 
And by what menë he desireth pes, 
To hym reserued /, as she gan specifie, 
The honour hool / and the regalye, 
with Sceptre and Crounë fro hym not devyded, 
But hool to hym / as he hath provided;
And Polymyte, be this condicioun, 
Vnder hym to regnen / in the toun 
As a Soget, be suffraunce of his brother.
But the Grekës / thouhten al another, 
And Specyaly worthy Tydeus, 
Pleynly affermyng it shuld nat be thus: 
The answer of Tydeus.


For he wil hauë / no condiciouns, 
But sette a-Syde / all excepciouns, 
Nothyng reservid / as in special, 
But hool the lordship, Regalye, and al, 
Polymytës it fully to possede, 
In Thebës Crownëd / verrayly in dede, 
As Rightful kyng / putte in pocessioun, 
lich the Couenauntys and conuencioun 
Imad of olde / assuryd, and asselyd, 
“which shall not now of nwë be repelyd, 
But stable and hool / in his strengthë stonde. 
And lat hym so platly vndyrstonde! 
And first that he devoyde hym out of toun, 
156
And delyuere the Sceptre / and the Croun 
To his brother / and mak therof no more. 
And shortly ellys It shal be bouht ful sore 
Or this mater brought be to an ende. 
For Grek is non / that shal hennys wende 
Or that our right / which is vs denyed, 
with lif or deth / darreynëd be and tryed: 
we wil not arst fro this towne remewe.
“And ȝif hym lyst / al this thyng eschwe 
And al meschief / styntyn and appese, 
To either part / he may do gret ese: 
Thus I menë / for his auauntage, 
Delyuer vp hool / the trewë herytage 
To his brother / for a ȝeer tendure. 
And Grekys shal fully hym assure, 
By what bonde that hym list devise, 
The ȝeer complet /, in our beste wise 
To hym delyuer / ageyn pocessioun 
with-outë strif / or contradiccioun. 
And to this fyn / Iustly hold vs to.
“And ȝif it fallë / that he wil nat so, 
Lat hym not wayte / but only after werre. 
The hour is come / we wil it not differre.
lo! her is al / and thus ȝe may reporte 
To hym ageyn / whan that ȝe resorte; 
Fro which apoynt / we cast vs not to varye.”
157
And ȝit to hym / Amphiorax contrarye 
Ful pleynly saide, in conclusioun, 
This fyn shal cause a destruccioun 
Of hem echon / ȝif it forth procede 
To be parfourmed / and execute in dede. 
But thilke tyme for al his elloquence 
He had in soth / but lytyl audience. 
For wherso euer / he ment / good or ille, 
kyng Adrastus / bad hym to be stille.
And tho Iocasta / as wisdom did hyr tech, 
humble of her port / with ful softe spech, 
Gan sekë menys / in hyr fantasye 
ȝif she myght the Irë modefye 
Of the Grekes / to make hem to enclyne 
In eny wise / hyr rancour forto fyne. 
She dyd hyr dever / and hir bysy cure.
But tho byfel a wonder aventure, 
Cause and ground / of gret confusioun, 
Grekys perturbyng / and also ek the toun, 
And it to tellë / may me not asterte. 
For which a whil / my styell I mot dyuerte, 
And shortly tellë /, by descripcioun, 
Of a Tigre dwellyng in the toun, 
which fro a kyngdam / besyden adiacent, 
Out of Egipte / was to Thebës sent: 
the whichë beest by record of scripture 
158
Is most swift / as of his nature, 
And of kynd also most sauage, 
And most cruel / whan he is in his rage, 
And, as Clerkys makë mencioun, 
He of body / resembleth the lyoun, 
And lik a greyhound / the mosel and the hed, 
And of Eyen / as eny fyret red, 
Ek of his Skyn /, wryten as I fynde, 
lich a panter / conuersant in ynde, 
with al maner hwys and colours; 
And is ful oft / disceyued with merours 
By fraude of huntys / and fals apparence 
Shewyd in glas / with-outen existence, 
whan his kyndles / arn be sleight ytake, 
And he deceyuëd / may no rescus make.
And lik a lombe / was this Tygre tame, 
Ageynys kynde /, myn autour writ the same.
And this beest, mervaillous to se, 
was sent to ymeyne and antigonè: 
which vnto hem / didë gret confort, 
And Cowdë playe / and makë good disport, 
lik a whelp / that is but ȝong of age; 
And to no wight didë no damage, 
No mor in soth / þan doth a litil hound; 
And it was worth many hundred pound 
Vnto the kyng /, for ay in his greuaunce 
159
Ther was no þing / did hym mor plesaunce, 
That for no tresour / it myght not be bought. 
For whan that he was pensif or in thought, 
It putt hym out of his hevynesse.
And thilkë tyme /, the story doth expresse, 
That Iocasta treted for a pes, 
This tamë Tygre / in party rekkëles, 
Out at the gates / in sight of many a man, 
Into the felde / wildëly out ran, 
And Casuelly rennyng to and fro, 
In and oute, as doth a tamë Roo; 
Grekys wenyng that wer ȝong of age, 
That this Tygre / haddë be sauage, 
And Cruelly besettyng al the place 
Round aboutë / gan hym to enchace 
Til he was ded / and slayën in the feld. 
The slauhter of whom whan þat they byheld, 
The proude Thebans / which on the wallys stood, 
They ronnë doune ful furious and wood, 
wenyng he had / be slayën of despit. 
Takyng her hors / with-outë mor respit, 
Fully in purpos / with Grekys forto fighte, 
The Tigres deth / tavengen ȝif they myghte. 
And out they rood / with-outë gouernaylle, 
And ful proudly / Grekës gan assaylle, 
And of hatred / and ful hegh desdayne 
160
Fyl vpon hem / that han the tygre slayne, 
And cruelly qwitten hem her mede, 
That many Greke / in the grenë mede, 
By the force / and the grete myght 
Of her Foomen, lay slayën in þis fight. 
The Tigres deth / so derë they aboughte, 
So mortally the Thebans on hem wroughte 
That al the host, in the feld liggyng, 
was astounyd / of this sodeyn thyng.
And in this whil, of Rancour rekkëles, 
Out of Thebës rood Ethiocles, 
And with hym ek / the worthy kyng Tremour, 
Of his hond a noble werreour, 
That madë Grekës to forsak her place, 
And to her tentys / gan hem to enchace. 
And myd the feld / as þei to-gyder mette 
On hors-bak / with sperës sharpë whette 
Of verray hate / and of envious pryde, 
Ful many on was ded on outher syde.
The manhod of Tydeus.

The whichë thyng / whan Tideus espieth, 
wood as lyoun / to hors-bak he hieth, 
As he that was neuer a del afferd; 
But ran on hem / and met hem in the berd, 
And Maugrè hem / in his crueltè, 
he made hem fleen / hom to her Citè, 
hem pursuyng / of ful dedly hate, 
161
That many on / lay slayën at the gate, 
Gapyng vprightys / with her woundys wyde; 
That vttrely / they durste not abyde 
To-for the swerd of this Tydeus. 
he was on hem so passing furius, 
So many theban / he roof vnto the herte 
That whan Iocasta / the slauhtre gan aduerte,
Polymytës / she gan prey ful fayre 
To makë Grekis / hom ageyn repayre, 
And that they wolden styntyn to assaylle 
For thilkë day / and cessen her bataylle. 
At whoos requeste / pleynly and preyere, 
And at Reuerence / of his moder dere, 
Polymytës, her herte to conforte, 
Grekës madë / hom ageyn resorte 
And Tydeus to stynten of his chas.
And they of Thebës hasting a gret pas, 
Ful trist and hevy / ben entred into toun. 
And for the Tygre, in conclusioun, 
As ȝe han herd / first began this stryff, 
That many theban / that day lost his lyff 
And recurlees / hath ȝolden vp the breth, 
In thavengyng / of the tygres deth.
And al this while / duëly as she ought, 
þe quene Iocasta / humblely besought 
162
Kyng Adrastus / only of his grace, 
Some menë way / wisly to purchace 
To make a pees / atwene the bretheren tweyn, 
And the tretè / so prudently ordeyne, 
On eiþer party / that no blood be shad. 
And this Adrastus / avisè and riȝt sad, 
For Grekis party / answer gaf anon, 
That other endë / shortly gete she non, 
lich as the lordis / fully ben avisyd, 
Than Tydeus hath aforn devisyd.
And whan she saugh it may non oþer be, 
She lievë tok / and hom to the Cytè 
She is repeirëd /, hauyng to hyr Guyde 
Polymytës Rydyng be her syde. 
And Tideus ladde Antigonè, 
And of Archadye / prothonolopè, 
The worthy kyng, did his bysy peyne 
To ben attendaunt / vpon fair ymeyne, 
Whos hert she hath / to her servisë luryd: 
And he ageyn hath purtraied and fyguryd 
Myd of his brest /, which lightly may not passe, 
Hooly the feturis / of her fresshly face. 
Hym thouht she was so faire a creature; 
And though that he durst hym not discure, 
Ȝit in his hert / as ferforth as he kan, 
He hath avowed / to ben her trwë man, 
vnwist to hir / pleynly and vnknowe 
163
How he was markëd with Cupidës bowe, 
with his Arwë / sodeynly werreyed. 
And to the ȝatë / the ladyes conueyed 
Ben entred In / for it drow to eve, 
Grekys of hem taking tho her leve; 
Thogh some of hem wer sory to departe, 
ȝit of wisdam / they durste not iuparte 
Vnder a conduit / to entren into toun, 
lest it turned to her confusion.
Thouh somë bookës / the contrarye seyn: 
But myn Autour / is platly ther-ageyn, 
And affermeth / in his opynyoun, 
That Tydeus / of hegh discrecioun, 
Of wilfulnessë / nor of no folye, 
Ne wold as tho put in Iupartie 
Nowther hym-silf / nor non of his ferys.
And the ladyes / with her heuenly cherys, 
Angelik / of look / and contenance, 
Lich as it is / put in remembrance, 
At her entryng from Grekys into toun, 
Polymytës / of gret affeccioun, 
The quen bysouhte / thilkë nyght not fyne 
For tasseyë ȝif she myght enclyne 
Ethiocles, of conscience and ryght, 
164
To kepë couenaunt / as he hath behight 
Ful ȝore agon / with the surplusage, 
List the contrarie / tournë to damage, 
First of hym-silf / and many an þer mo.
And thus fro Thebës / grekys ben ago 
To her Tentys / and rest hem al that nyght. 
And Lucyna / the monë shon ful bright 
with-Innë Thebës / on the chief dongoun, 
whan Iocasta made relacioun 
Vnto the kyng / and told hym al the Guyse, 
How that Grekys vttrely despyse 
his profre made be fals collusioun; 
Only excepte / the conuencioun, 
Of old engrocyd by gret purvyance, 
which is enrollyd / and put in remembrance, 
Vpon which they fynaly wil reste: 
hym counsaillinge /, hir thouhte for the beste, 
To conforme hym / to that he was bounde, 
lyst in the fyn / falsnesse hym confounde.
But al hir counsayl / he set it at no prys, 
he dempt hym-silf / so prudent and so wys; 
For he was wilful / and he was indurat, 
And in his hert / of malyce obstynat, 
And outtrely / avisëd in his þouht, 
with-Innë Thebes / his brother get right nouht. 
165
And in his Errour / þus I lete him dwelle.
And of Grekis / forth I wil ȝou telle, 
which al that nyght kepte hem-siluë cloos. 
And on the morow / whan Tytan vp aroos, 
They armyd hem / and gan hem redy make, 
And of assent / han the felde I-take, 
With the Thebans / that day, out of doute, 
Forto fighten / ȝif they yssen oute.
And Adrastus / in ful thrifty wise, 
In the feld / his wardys / gan devise, 
As he that was / of all deceytës war. 
And richëly I-armyd / in his char 
Amphiorax cam with his meynè, 
Ful renomyd of antiquitè, 
And wel expert / be-causë he was old. 
And whil that Grekys, as I haue ȝou told, 
wer bysiest her wardys to ordeyne, 
Myd of the feld / bifyl a cas sodeyne, 
Ful vnhappy / lothsom, and odyble; 
How Amphiorax fil doune into hell.


For liche a thing / þat wer invisible, 
This oldë bisshop / with char and hors certeyn 
Disaperyd / and no mor was seyne. 
Only of fate / which no man can repelle, 
þe erth opnede / and he fille doun to helle, 
with all his folk / þat vpon hym abood. 
And sodeynly / the grounde on which he stood 
Closyd ageyn / and to-gydre shette, 
166
þat neuer after Grekis with hym mette. 
And thus the devel / for his old outrages, 
lich his decert, paiëd hym his wages. 
For he ful lowe / is discendid doun 
Into the dirk and blakë Regyoun 
wher that Pluto / is crownyd and ystallyd 
with his quene / proserpina I-callyd. 
with whom this bisshop / haþ made his mansioun 
Perpetuelly / as for his guerdoun.
lo here the mede / of ydolatrie, 
Of Rytys old / and of fals mawmetrye. 
lo / what auayllen Incantaciouns 
Of exorsismës / and coniurisouns; 
what stood hym stede his Nigromancye, 
Calculacioun / or astronomye; 
what vayllëd hym / the heuenly manciouns, 
Diuerse aspectis / or constellaciouns? 
The ende / is nat / bot sorowe and meschaunce, 
Of hem þat setten / her outre affiaunce 
In swichë werkës supersticious, 
Or trist on hem /: he is vngracious.
Record I takë, shortly forto telle, 
Of this bysshop / sonken doun to helle, 
whos wooful ende / about in euery cost 
Swich a Rumour / hath makëd in the host 
167
That the noys / of this vnkouth thyng 
Is yronne / and comë to the kyng, 
how this vengeaunce / is vnwarly falle. 
And he anon / made a trumpet calle 
Alle his puple / out of the feld ageyn; 
And euerychon / assembled on a pleyn 
To-fore the kyng / and also rounde aboute. 
Euery man / of his lyf in doute, 
Ful pitously / gan to frowne and loure, 
list that the grounde hem alle wil deuoure 
And Swalowen hem / in his dirkë kave; 
And they ne can / no recur hem to save. 
For nouther force / nor manhode may availle 
In swiche meschief / the valewe of a maylle. 
For he that was wisest / and koudë most 
To serche and sekë / thorgh-out al the host, 
Amphiorax / whan that he lest wende, 
To helle is sonken / and coude hym not diffende, 
(To hym the tyme vnknowen and vnwist) 
In whom whilom was al þe Grekis trist, 
her hoolë confort / and her affiaunce.
But all attonys / for this sodeyn chaunce 
And this meschief / they gan hem to dispeire, 
168
Hom to Grecë / that they wil repeyre. 
This was the purpoos / of hem euerichon.
And on the wallys / of Thebës lay her fon, 
Reioysing hem / of this vnhappy eure, 
wenyng therby / gretly to recure. 
And on her tourës / as they loken oute, 
They on Grekys / enviously gan shoute, 
And, of despit / and gret enmytè, 
Bad hem foolys / gon hom to her contrè, 
Sith they han lost / her confort and socour, 
her false prophete / and her dyvynour: 
wherthorgh / her partie / gretly is apeyryd. 
And in this wisë / Grekys disespeyryd, 
Demptë pleynly / be tokens evidente, 
This cas was falle / by som enchauntëment, 
By wichëcraft / or by fals sorcerye, 
Ageynës which may be no remedye, 
Tristy diffencë / helpë, nor socour.
And whan Adrastus herde this clamour, 
he bysy was ageyn this perturbaunce 
To provyde / some maner chevysaunce. 
And to hym calleth / such counsayl as he wiste, 
For lyf or deth / that he myghte tryste, 
Requeryng hem / but in wordys fewe, 
In this meschief / her mocioun to shewe, 
169
And declare by good avisëment 
What to Grekys / was most expedient, 
To remedyen /, and makë no delay, 
The vncouth noyse / and the gret affray 
That Grekys made / with clamour inportune, 
And newe / and newe / euere in on contune.
And they that wern / most manly and most wise, 
Shortly saide / it wer a cowardyse, 
The hegh emprise / that they han vndirtake 
For dred of deth / so sodeynly forsake. 
It wer to hem / a perpetuel shame 
And outre hyndryng / vnto grekys name; 
And better it wer / to euery werreyour 
Manly to deye / with worship and honour, 
Than lik a coward / with the lyf endure. 
For onys shamyd / hard is to recure 
his name ageyn / of what estat he be. 
And sith Grekes / of old antiquytè, 
As of knyghthode /, who so list tak hed, 
Ben so famous / and so renomëd, 
Ȝif now of newe / the shyning of her Fame 
Eclipsid were / with eny spotte of blame, 
It were a thyng vncouth forto here, 
170
Of whoes renoun / the bemës ȝit ben clere 
Thorgh al the world / wher as they han passyd, 
And ben not ȝit / dyrkyd nor diffacyd, 
By no report / nouther on se ne londe

“And by example / of our progenitours, 
Þat whilom wern / so manly conquerours, 
To-forn that we into Grecë wende, 
Of thyng bygon / lat vs make an ende, 
And parte nat / nor Seuere from this toun

Vpon our foon /, with worship vnrepreuyd.”
This was the counsaylle / shortly, and thavis 
Of the Grekys that manly wern and wys, 
That neuere aforn wer markyd with no blame, 
And specialy / swich as dredë Shame, 
And fully caste / what fortune euer tyde, 
On her purpoos / to the ende abyde, 
That on no part / her honure not apalle. 
171
And to this counsaille / Grekys, on and alle, 
Ben condescendyd / and, for mor happy sped, 
In sted of hym / that was so latë ded, 
Amphiorax / buryed / depe in helle, 
That koudë whilom / to the Grekys telle 
Of thynggës hid / how it shal falle, aforn: 
In stede of whom / now they han hym lorn, 
They casten hem / wisly to purchace 
How Grekes chosen hem / a new dyvynour in stede of Amphiorax.


Some prudent man / to occupye his place, 
That in swich thyng / myght hem most availle 
Thorgh mystery of his dyvynaylle, 
By craft of sorte / or of profecye, 
ȝif eny swich they couden out espye.
And among al /, her purpoos to atteyne, 
As I fyndë / they han chosyn tweyne, 
Most renomed / of hem euerychon. 
And Menolippus / callyd was the ton, 
And Terdymus / ek the tother highte. 
And for he hadde most fauour in her sighte, 
This Terdymus / was chosen and preferryd. 
And in her choys / Grekys han not erryd; 
For whilom he / lernyd / his emprise 
Of his maister / Amphiorax the wyse, 
And was disciple / vndyr his doctrine. 
And of entent / that he shal termyne 
Vnto Grekys / thyngës that shal falle, 
As a bisshop mytred in his stalle, 
172
They don for him / in many vncouth wyse 
In the temple / to goddys sacrifise; 
And thus confermed / and stallyd in his Se, 
A fewë dayës / stood / in his degrè, 
After his mayster / with ful gret honour, 
Of Grekys chosë / to be successour.
And al this tyme /, in story as is told, 
Ful gret meschief / of hungre, thrust, and cold; 
And of Thebans / as they issen oute, 
lay many on / slayën in the route 
On outher part /, of fortune as they mette: 
her mortal swerdys / wer so sharpë whette.
And Tydeus among hem of the toun 
Fro day to day / pleyeth þe lyoun 
So cruelly, wher so that he rood, 
That Theban non / aforn his face abood. 
He made of hem, thorgh his high renown, 
So gret slaughter / and occisioun 
That as the deth / fro his swerd they fledde, 
And who cam nexte / leid his lyf to wedde. 
He qwitte hym-sylf / so lik a manly knyght 
That wher he went / he putte hem to the flight, 
And maugrè hem, in his crueltè 
He droff hem hom / into her Citè, 
hem purswyng / proudly to the gate: 
173
That vnto hym / they bar so dedly hate 
That they hem caste / by sleyht or some engyn, 
To bryngyn hym / vnwarly to hys fyn; 
And leyde awayt / for hym day and nyght. 
But O. allas! / this noble manly knyght, 
Vpon a day / as he gan hem enchace, 
How pitously Tydeus was slayn with a quarell.


And mortally / made hem lese her place 
And sued hem / almost to the toun, 
That causë was of his destruccioun. 
For on, allas! / that on the wallys stood, 
which al that day / vpon hym abood, 
With a quarel / sharpe heded for his sake, 
Markede hym with a bowe of brake, 
So cruelly, makynge non arest 
Tyl it was passyd bothë bak and brest. 
Wherthorgh, allas! / ther was non oþer red 
Nor lechë-craft / but that he mot be ded, 
Ther may therof be makëd non delayes. 
And ȝit was he / holdyn / in his dayes 
The beste knyght / and most manly man, 
As myn Autour / wel rehercë kan. 
But for al that was ther no dyffence 
Ageyn the strok / of dethys violence. 
And Bochas writ / er he was fully ded, 
he was by Grekys / presentyd with þe hed 
Of hym that gaf / his laste fatal wounde: 
And he was callyd /, lik as it is founde, 
Menolippus /, I can non other telle.
174
But thilkë day / Thebans wex so felle 
He that slogh Tydeus was callyd Menolippus.

Vpon Grekys / that vnder her Cytè 
The manly kyng Parthanolopè 
Islayën was / euene afor the gatys; 
And ther also, Armyd bright in platys, 
The famous kyng / callyd ypomedoun, 
The samë day /, as mad is mencioun, 
On hors-bak / manly as he faught, 
At the briggë / euene vpon the draught, 
Besette with pres / casuelly was drownyd. 
And thus fortunë / hath on Grekys frownyd 
On euery sydë / thilk vnhappy day. 
But al the maner / tellen I ne may 
Of her fightyng / nor her slaughter in soth, 
Mor to declarë / than myn Autour doth.
But thilkë day / I fynde / as ȝe may sen, 
whan Phebus / passyd was merydyen 
And fro the south / westward gan hym drawe, 
his gylte tressys / to bathen in the wawe,
The Theban kyng / felle Ethyocles, 
Rote of vnreste / and causer of vnpes, 
The slauhter of Grekys / whan that he beheld, 
Armyd in steel / he kam out in-to feld, 
Ful desirous / in that sodeyn hete 
Polymytës / at good leyser to mete, 
175
Syngulerly / with hym to han ado. 
For in this world / he hatede no man so; 
he sat so nygh / emprented in his herte. 
whoos comyng out / his brother gan aduerte 
Vpon his stede / in the opposit, 
And hadde ageynward / also gret delyt 
To meten hym / ȝif fortune assente. 
Thenvious fyr / so her hertys brente 
with haate Cankered / of vnkyndë blood. 
And lik two Tygres / in her ragë wood, 
with speerys sharpë / groundë for the nonys, 
So as they ranne / and mettë both attonys, 
Polymytës / thorgh platys, mayle, and sheeld 
How euerich of the Theban bretheren slogh other to-forn þe Cyte.


Roof hym thorgh-out / and smette hym in-to feld. 
But whan he sauh / the stremys of his blood 
Raylle about / in maner of a flood, 
Al sodeynly / of compassioun, 
From his coursere / he alighte doun, 
And brotherly, with a pitous face, 
To saue his lyf / gan hym to vnbrace, 
And from his wounde / of newe affeccioun, 
Ful bysy was / to pulle out the trunchoun, 
176
Of loue only / handlyng hym ryght softe. 
But O / allas! whil he lay alofte, 
Ful yrously / Ethiocles the felle, 
Of al this sorowe / verraye sours and welle, 
with a dagger / in al his peynys smerte, 
his brother smoot vnwarly to the herte: 
which al her lyf / haddë be so wrothe. 
And thus the Thebans / were yslawë bothe 
At the entrè / euene aforn the toun.
But Grekys / tho / ben availled doun 
Out of the feld / the worthy knyghtys alle. 
And in Thebës / loud / as eny shalle, 
The Cry aroos / whan her kyng was ded. 
And to the gatys / armyd foot and hed, 
Out of the toun / cam many proud Theban. 
And some of hem / vpon the wallys ran 
And gan to shoute / that pitè was to here. 
And they with-out / of her lyf in were, 
with-oute confort // or consolacioun, 
Disespeyrëd / ronne hom to the toun 
And Grekys folowen after at the bak, 
That many on / that day / goth to wrak. 
177
And as her foomen / proudely hem assaylle 
Ful many Grek / thorgh platys and thorgh maylle 
was shette thorgh-out, pressyng at the wallys, 
And betyn of / with grete roundë ballys, 
That her lay on / and another ȝonder. 
And the noysë, hydouser than thonder, 
Of gonnë-shot and of Arblastys ek, 
So loude out-ronge / that many worthy grek 
Ther lost his lyf /; they wern on hem so felle.
And at the gatys /, shortly forto telle, 
As Grekys prees / to entren þe Cytè, 
They of Thebës / in her Crueltè 
with hem mette / ful furious and wood, 
And mortally / as they ageyn hem stood, 
Men myghte sen / sperys Shyuere a-sonder, 
That to byhold / it was a verray wonder 
how they foyne / with daggers and with swerdys, 
Thorgh the vyser / amyng at the berdys, 
Percyng also / thorgh the rownde Maylles, 
Rent out peces / of ther aventaylles, 
That nouht availleth / the myghty Geseran, 
178
Thorgh brest / and nekkë / that the sperys Ran. 
her wepnys wern / so sharpë grounde and whet, 
In ther armurë / that ther was no let. 
For ther laye on / troden vnder foote, 
And ȝonder / on / percyd to the herte roote. 
Her lith on ded / and ther another lame. 
This was / the play / and the mortal game 
Atwenë Thebans / and the Grekys proude, 
That the swowys / and the cryës loude 
Of hem that lay / and ȝolden vp the goost, 
was herd ful fer / aboute in many cost.
How al the gentyl blood of grece and Thebes was distroyed on / o . / day.

And at the gatys / and sayllyng of þe wal 
Islayën was / al the blood Royal, 
Both of the toun / and of Grekys lond, 
And all the worthy knyghtys of her hond. 
And of lordys /, ȝif I shal not feyne, 
On Grekys syde / alyvë wer but tweyne, 
Kyng Adrastus / and Campaneus. 
That day to hem / was so vngracius.
And for Titan / westryd was so lowe 
That no man myght vnnethys other knowe, 
Tho of the toun / shet her gatys faste 
179
with barrys rounde / makëd forto laste, 
In which no wight kervë may nor hewe.
And Adrastus / with a grekys fewe 
Repeyrëd is hom vnto his Tent, 
And al that nyght / he wastyd hath and spent 
For his vnhappe / in sorowe compleynyng.
And they in Thebes / the nexte day swyng 
her devoyre did / and her bysy cure, 
To ordeyne and make / a sepulture 
For her kyng / yslayën in the feeld; 
And offred vp his baner and his sheld, 
His helme / his swerd, and also his penoun, 
Ther-Inne of gold / I-betyn a dragoun, 
high in the temple / that men myghte sen.
And Iocasta / that infortunyd quene, 
her sonës deth / soorë gan compleyne; 
And also ek / her ȝonge doghtres tweyne, 
Both ymeyne / and Antigonee, 
Cryden and wepte / that pytè was to se. 
But to her sorowes / that was non refut. 
And thus the Citè / bar / and destitut, 
havyng no wight to gouern hem ne guye: 
For ded and slayn / was al the Chyualrye, 
And no wight left almost in þe toun 
180
To regne vpon hem / by successioun.
But for they saugh / and tokyn also hed, 
with-outë þis / that they hadde an hed 
In the Cytè / þei may not durë longe: 
For though so be Comownerys be stronge 
with multitude / and have no gouernaylle 
Of an hed /, ful lytyl may avaylle: 
Therfor they han vnto her socour 
ychosyn hem a newë gouernour, 
How creaunt þe olde Tyraunt was chosen kyng of Thebes.

An olde Tyraunt / þat callyd was Creon, 
Ful acceptable / to hem euerichon, 
And crownyd hym / with-oute mor lettyng, 
To regne in Thebës / and to ben her kyng, 
Al-thogh he hadde no title by discent 
But by fre choys / made in parlement. 
And ther to hym, lik as it is founde, 
By her lygeaunce / of newë they wer bounde, 
For to be trewë / whyl the Citè stood, 
To hym only / with body and with good. 
Thus they wer sworn / and suryd euerichon; 
And he ageynward / to saue hem from her foon, 
And hem dyffende / with al his fullë myght, 
And meynten hem / in al manere ryght. 
This was thacord / as in sentement.
And in this whilë hath Adrastus sent 
181
From the Siege of Thebës the Cytè 
A woundyd knyght hom to his contrè, 
Thorgh al Grecë / pleynly to declare 
Al þe slaughter and the evyl fare 
Of worthy Grekys, ryght as it is falle, 
And how that he hath lost his lordys alle 
Att mor meschief / þan eny man can mouth.
And whan this thyng / was in grecë couth, 
Fyrst to Argyve / and Deyphylee, 
And to the ladies / ek in the contrè 
And of provynces / aboute hem adiacent, 
They comë doun /, al be on assent, 
Worthy queenys / and with hem ek duchessys, 
And other ek / that callyd were contessys, 
And alle the ladyes / and wymmen of degrè 
Ben assembled / in Argë the Cytè, 
How alle þe ladyes of Grece Arayde hem toward Thebes.


lik as I rede /, and alle in clothës blake; 
That to byhold / the sorowe that they make,
It were a deth / to eny man alyve.
And ȝif I shuldë / by and by descryve 
Ther tendre wepyng and ther wooful sownys, 
her complayntys / and lamentacions, 
her ofte swounyng / with facys ded and pale, 
Ther-of I myghte make a newë tale, 
182
Almost a day / ȝow to occupye.
And as myn Autour / doth clerly certifie, 
Thurgh-outë Grece / from all þe Rigiouns 
Out of Cities / and of Royal touns 
Cam alle the ladies / and wymmen of estat, 
Ful hevy-cheryd / and disconsolat, 
To this assemblè /, aforn as I ȝou tolde, 
In purpoos fully / her Iournè forto holde 
Toward Thebës / thys sorwful creaturys, 
Ther to bywaylle / her wooful auenturys, 
Taquyte hem-silf / of trouth in wommanhede 
To her lordys / which in the feld lay dede.
And as the story / liketh to declare, 
Al this Iournè / they went on foote bare, 
lik as they haddë / gon on pylgrymage, 
In tokyn of mournyng / barbyd þe visage, 
Wympled echon / and in burnet weedys. 
Nat in charys / drawën forth with stedys, 
Nor on palfreys blakë nowther white, 
The Sely wymmen koude hem not delite 
To hold her way / but barfote forth they wente, 
So feithfully / euerichon they ment, 
Thorgh hevynesse / diffacyd of her hwe. 
And as I fyndë, they weryn alle trwe.
Now was not þat / a wonder forto se 
183
So many trewe / out of a cuntrè, 
Attonys gadryd / in a companye, 
And feithful allë /, bookys can not lye, 
Both in her port / and inward in menyng? 
Vnto my doom / it was an vncouth thyng, 
Among a thowsand wymen outher tweyne 
To fynden noon / that kowde in hertë feyne. 
It was a mervaylle / nat ofte seyn aforn. 
For seelde / in feldys / groweth eny corn 
But ȝif some wede / spryng vp þer-among. 
Men allaye wynys / whan they be to strong; 
But her trouth was meynte wiþ non allayes, 
They were so trewë / founde at alle assayes.
And they ne stynt / vpon her iournè 
Tyl that they cam þer as they wolde be, 
wher Adrastus /, wrytyn as I fynde, 
lay in his Tent / al of colour ynde; 
Gretly mervaylyd / whan that he biheld 
The nombre of hem / sprad thorgh al þe feld, 
Clad all in blak / and barfoot euerychon. 
Out of his Tent / he dressyd hym anon, 
Vpon his hand / the kyng Campaneus; 
Ful trist in herte / and facë right pitous, 
184
Ageyn the wommen / forth they went yfere.
And to byhold / the wooful hevy chere, 
The wooful cryës / also, whan they mette, 
The sorful sighys / in her brestys shette, 
The teerys newe / distillyng on her facys, 
And the swownyng / in many sondry placys, 
whan they her lordys / alyvë not ne founde, 
But in the feeld / thorgh-girt with many wounde, 
lay stark vpriȝtës /, pleynly to endite, 
with dedly eyën / tournyd vp the white, 
who madë sorowe / or felt her hertë Ryve 
For hir lorde / but the faire Argyve? 
who can now wepë / But Deyphylee 
Tydeus / for she ne myghte se? 
whoos constreyntys were so fel and kene 
That Adrastus myghte not sustene 
How creon wil not suffre the bodies nowther to be buryed nor brent.

To byholde the ladyes so compleyne, 
wisshing his herte / parted wer on tweyne.
And ȝit, allas! / bothen eve and morowe, 
O thyng ther was / that doubled al her sorowe, 
That Old Creon / fader of fellonye, 
Ne woldë suffre, thorgh his Tyrannye, 
The dedë bodies / be buryed nowther brente, 
185
But with beestis and houndys to be rente. 
he made hem all / vpon an hepe be leyde. 
wherof the wymmen trist and evyl apeyde, 
For verray dool, as it was no wonder, 
her hertys felt almost ryve a-sonder.
And as my mayster Chaucer list endite, 
Al clad in blak / with her wymples whyte, 
With gret honour / and duë reuerence, 
In the temple / of the goddesse Clemence 
They abood the space / of fourtënyght 
Tyl Theseus / the noble worthy knyght, 
Duk of Athenys / with his Chyvalrye 
Repeyrëd hom / out of Femynye, 
And with hym ladde / ful feir vpon to sene, 
Thorgh his manhod / ypolita the quene, 
And her suster / callyd Emelye.
and whan thies wommen / gonnë first espye 
This worthy Duk / as he cam rydynge, 
Kyng Adrastus /, hem alle conveyinge, 
The wommen brouht vnto his presence, 
which hym bysought / to ȝive hem audience. 
And all attonys swownyng in the place, 
Ful humblely / preiden hym of grace 
To rewe on hem / her harmys to redresse. 
But ȝif ȝe list / to se the gentyllesse 
Of Theseus / how he hath hym born, 
186
Ȝif ȝe remembre / ȝe han herde it to forn 
wel rehersyd / at Depforth in the vale, 
In the bygynnyng / of the knyghtys tale:
How the fynal destruccioun of Thebes is compendeously rehersyd in þe knyghtes tale.

First how that he / whan he herd hem speke, 
For verray routhë felt his hertë / breke; 
And her sorowys / whan he gan aduerte, 
From his courser / doun anon he sterte, 
Hem confortyng in ful good entente, 
And in his Armys he hem all vp hente. 
The knyghtys tale / reherseth euery del 
Fro poynt to poynt / ȝif ȝe lookë wel, 
And how this Duk / with-oute more abood, 
The samë day / toward Thebës rood, 
Ful lik in soth / a worthy conquerour, 
And in his hoost / of Chyualrye the flour. 
And fynally, to spekyn of thys thing, 
with old Creon / that was of Thebës kyng, 
how that he faught / and slough hym lik a knyght, 
And all his host / putte vnto the flyght.
ȝit, as some auctours makë mencioun, 
Or Theseus entred into toun, 
The women first with pikkeys and with mallys, 
with gret labour / betë doun the wallys. 
And in her writyng also as they sayn, 
Campaneus / was on the wallys slayn, 
with cast of ston / he was so ouerlade; 
For whom Adrastus / such a sorowe made 
That no man myght reles hym of his peyne. 
And Iocasta /, with her doghtres tweyne, 
187
Ful woofully oppressyd of her cherys, 
To Athenës wer sent as prysonerys. 
What fil of hem more / can I not seyn.
But Theseus /, myn Autour writ certeyn, 
Out of the feld / or he fro Thebës wente, 
He bete it downe / and the howsys brente, 
The puple slough / for al her crying loude, 
Maad her wallys / and her towrys proude 
Rounde aboute /, euene vpon a rowe, 
with the Soyle / to be laide ful lowe 
That nouȝt was left / but the soyle al bare. 
And to the wommen / in reles of her care, 
The bonys of her lordys / that were slayn 
This worthy duk / restoryd hath agayn. 
How Duk Theseus delyuered to the ladies the bodyes of her lordys.


But what shuld I / any lenger dwelle 
The oldë Ryytys / by and by to telle, 
Nor thobsequies / in ordre to devise; 
Nor to declare / the manere and the Guyse 
how the bodyes / wer to Asshes brent, 
Nor of the gommës / in the flaumbë spent, 
To make the ayre / swetter of relees, 
As fraunc encence / Mirre and Aloës; 
Nor how the wommen / round aboutë stood, 
Somë with mylk / and some also with blood, 
And some of hem with vrnës made of gold, 
whan the asshes fully weren made cold, 
Tenclosyn hem of gret affeccioun 
And bern hem hom / into her Regioun; 
188
And how that other / ful dedly of her loke, 
For loue only / of the bonys tooke, 
Hem to kepë / for a remembraunce: 
That to reherce / euery obseruaunce 
That was don / in the fyrës bright, 
The wakë-playës / duryng al the nyght, 
Nor of the wrastlyng / to telle poynt be poynt, 
Of hem that werën / nakyd and enoynt, 
how eueriche other luggë gan and shake; 
Nor how the wommen han her levë take 
Of Theseus / with ful gret humblesse, 
Thankyng hym of his worthynesse 
That hym lyst vpon her woo to rewe; 
And how that he, his fredam to renewe, 
with the wommen, of his hegh largesse, 
ypartyd hath / ek of his Richesse;
And how this Duk Thebës ek forsoke 
And to Athenys / the righte wayë tooke, 
with laurer crownyd / in signe of victorye, 
And the palme of conquest and of glorye, 
Did his honur / duëly to marte; 
And how the wymmen wepte whan they departe 
with kyng Adrastus / hom ageyn to Arge: 
Kyng Adrastus with the ladyes repeyred hom ageyn to Arge.

To tellyn al, it wer to gret a charge,
And ek also, as ȝe shal vnderstonde, 
At the gynnyng I took no mor on honde 
Be my promys, in conclusioun, 
But to rehercë the destruccioun 
189
Of myghty Thebës / shortly, and no more.
And thus Adrastus, with his lokkys hore, 
Stille abood in Argë his Cytè 
Vnto his ende /: ȝe gete no more of me, 
Sauf, as myn auctour / liketh to compyle, 
After that he lyuëd but a while; 
For he was old er the siegë gan, 
And thought and sorowe so vpon hym ran; 
The which in soth shortyd hath his dayes. 
And, tymë sette, deth makeþ no delayes, 
And al his Ioyë / passid was and gon, 
For of his lordys / alyvë was not on 
But slayn at Thebes /, ȝe knowën al the cas.
and whan this kyng / in Argë buryed was 
Ful Ryaly / with gret solempnytè, 
It was acountyd /, in bookys ȝe may Se,
Four hundred ȝeer /, as mad is mencioun, 
To-foor the beelding / and fundacioun 
CCCC ȝere to-fore þe fundacioun of Rome was Thebes destroyed.


Of gret Rome / so Ryal and so large,
whan the ladies / departyden from Arge 
To her contrès / ful trest and desolat. 
lo / her the fyn / of contek and debat. 
Lo / her the myght of Mars the froward sterre. 
Lo / what it is / for-to gynne a werre.
How it concludeth / ensample ȝe may se 
First of Grekys / and next of the Cytè: 
190
For owther parte / hath matere to conpleyne. 
And in her strif / ȝe may se thynggës tweyne:
The worthy blood of Grece was distroyed at the siege and the Cyte fynaly brouht to nought.

The worthy of blood of grecë spilt, 
And Thebës ek /, of Amphion first bylt, 
With-oute Recur / brouht vnto Ruyne 
And with the soyle made pleyn as a lyne, 
To wyldernessë turnyd / and desert, 
And Grekys ek / falle into pouert, 
Both of her men / and also of her good; 
For fynaly / al the gentyl blood 
was shad out ther /, her woundys wer so wyde, 
To los fynal vnto outher syde.
For in the werre is non excepcioun 
Of hegh estat / nor lowh condicioun, 
But as fortune / and fatë, both yffere, 
List to disposë / with her double chere, 
Bellona is goddesse of bataill.

And Bellona / the goddes in hir char 
Aforn provydeth /; wherfor ech man be war 
Vnavysed / a werrë to bygynne. 
For no man woot who shal lese or wynne. 
And hard it is whan eyther party leseth. 
And doutëles / nowther of hem cheseth 
That they most / in al swich mortal rage, 
Maugrè her lust /, felyn gret damage. 
It may nat be by mannys myght restreyned. 
And werre in soth / was neuer first ordeyned 
191
But for synne folkis to chastyse.
And as the byble / trewly kan devyse, 
How that werre byganne in heuene by the pride and surquedye of Lucyfer.


Hegh in heuene / of Pryde and Surquedye, 
Lucyfer, fader of Envie, 
The olde Serpent /, he levyathan, 
Was the first / that euer werrë gan: 
Whan Michael /, the heuenly Champioun, 
with his Feerys / venqwisshyd the Dragoun, 
And to hellë / cast hym downe ful lowe. 
The whiche serpent hath the Cokkyl sowe 
lollium


Thorgh al erth / of envye and debat, 
That vnnethys / is ther non estat, 
with-outë stryf / can lyve in Charitè. 
For euery man / of hegh and lough degrè, 
Envyeth now / that other shulde thryve.
And ground and causë / why that men so stryve, 
Is coveytise / and fals Ambicioun, 
That euerich wold han domynacioun 
Ouer other, and trede hym vndyr foote: 
which of al sorowe / gynnyng is and Roote. 
And Crist recordyth /—red luk and ȝe may se— 
For lak of love / what meschief þer shal be. 
Surget gens contra gentem, Luce xxio.


For .O. puple / as he doth devyse, 
Agayn anoþer / of hatë shal aryse. 
And after tellith what dyvisions 
192
Ther shal be / atwixë regyouns, 
Eueriche bysy / other to oppresse. 
And al swich strif /, as he berth wytnesse, 
Kalendys ben /, I take his word to borowe, 
And a gynnyng / of meschief and of sorowe: 
Men haue it foundë / be experience.
But the venym / and the violence 
Of strif, of werre / of contek, and debat, 
That makeþ londys bare and desolat, 
Shal be proscript and voyded out of place, 
And Martys swerd / shal no more manace, 
Nor his sperë / greuous to sustene, 
Shal now no morë / whettyd be so kene, 
Nor he no morë / shal his hauberk shake. 
But loue and pees / in hertys shal awake, 
And charitè /, both in length and brede, 
Of newë shal her bryghte beemys sprede 
Thorgh grace / only / in dyuers naciouns, 
Forto reforme / a-twixë Regyouns 
Pees and quyet / concord and vnytè. 
And he that is / both on / and two / and thre, 
Ek thre in on / and souereyn lord of pes, 
Which in this exil / for our sakë ches, 
For loue only / our troubles to termyne, 
For to be born / of a pur virgyne:
And lat vs prey / to hym that is most good, 
193
Which for mankynde shadde his hertë blood, 
Thorgh byseching / of that heuenly quene, 
Wyff and moder and a Maydë clene, 
To sende vs pes / her in this lyf present, 
And of oure synnys / parfit amendëment, 
And Ioye eternal / whan we hennës wende. 
Of my talë / thus I make an ende.
